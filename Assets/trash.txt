Footprint Web Infrast ructure: Hidden Content Discovery
• Discover any hidden content and functionality that is not reachable from the main visible content to exploit user privileges within the application
• This allows an attacker to recover backup copies of live files, configuration files and log files containing sensitive data, backup archives containing snapshots of files within the web root, new functionality that is not linked to the main application, etc.

Web Spidering/Crawling
• Web spiders/crawlers automatically discover hidden content and functionality by parsing HTML forms and client-side JavaScript requests and responses
• Attackers use tools such as OWASP Zed Attack Proxy, Burp Suite, WebScarab, and Web Data Extractor Pro for web spidering

User-Directed Spidering
• Attackers use standard web browsers to walk through the target website functionalities
• Attackers use tools such as Burp Suite and WebScarab, which combine web spider and intercepting proxy features, to monitor and analyze the target website's traffic

OWASP Zed Attack Proxy

Footprint Web Infrast ructure: Detect Load Balancers
• Organizations use load balancers to distribute web server load on multiple servers and increase the productivity and reliability of web applications
• Attackers use various tools such as dig, and load balancing detector (lbd), to detect load balancers and their real IP addresses 

dig and ibd

Detect ing Load Balancers using AI
• An attacker can also leverage AI-powered ChatGPT or other generative AI technology to perform this task by using an appropriate prompt such as:
▪ “Use load balancing detector on target domain yahoo.com.”

----

Footprint Web Infrastructure: Detect ing Web App Technologies
• Attackers try to discover the underlying technologies used to build a web application to understand the attack surface and identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited

Wappalyzer
Attacker use Wappalyzer to identify the technology stack of any website, such as CMS, ecommerce platform or payment processor, etc.

BuiltWith
BuiltWith enables attackers to identify the technology stack used by websites

----

Footprint Web Infrast ructure: WebSockets Enum erat ion
• Attackers enumerate the WebSockets on a target site to identify the running WebSocket servers, using tools such as STEWS (Security Testing and Enumeration of WebSockets)

STEWS
• STEWS allows attackers to discover WebSocket endpoints, determine what server is running on each endpoint, and identify known vulnerabilities
• Run the following command to perform Websocket enumeration on the target web application
python3 STEWS-fingerprint.py -1 -k -u <target URL>
