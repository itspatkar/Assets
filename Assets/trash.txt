Web Application Firewall (WAF)

    Purpose: Protects web applications from attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
    Features:
        Filters HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
        Enforces application-specific security rules.


Network Access Control (NAC)

    Purpose: Ensures that only authorized and compliant devices can access the network.
    Features:
        Device authentication before granting access.
        Quarantines non-compliant devices for remediation.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

    Purpose: Centralized logging and analysis of security events across the organization.
    Features:
        Aggregates logs from multiple devices.
        Correlates events to identify potential security incidents.
        Provides dashboards for monitoring and alerting.


Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

    Purpose: An advanced version of a firewall with integrated features.
    Features:
        Deep packet inspection.
        Application awareness and control.
        Integrated IDS/IPS functionality.

Keyscan_dump command to sniff user keystrokes on the target machine. This command dumps all the sniffed keystrokes and displays them on the console.
Use the keyscan_stop command to stop sniffing keystrokes.
Attackers can also automate the entire sniffing and data dumping process using the Metasploit lockout_keylogger exploit.
Use user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) tools to detect user behavior anomalies indicating attempts to cover tracks.

STEP 1: Create a new Trojan packet using njRAT
STEP 2: Employ a dropper such as Amadeyor SecuriDropper, or a downloader such as Downloader.DN, to install the malicious code on the target system
STEP 3: Employ a wrapper, such as IExpress Wizard, to bind the Trojan to a legitimate file 
STEP 4: Employ a crypter, such as The Attacker-Crypter, to encrypt the Trojan 
STEP 5: Propagate the Trojan by various methods, such as emails or USB 
STEP 6: Deploy the Trojan on the victim’s machine by executing a dropper or downloader on the target machine 
STEP 7: Execute the damage routine

-------

Step 1: 

Step 2: Employ a dropper such as Amadey or SecuriDropper, or a downloader such as Downloader.DN, to install the malicious code on the target system.The dropper appears to users as a legitimate application or a well-known and trusted file. However, when it is run, it extracts the malware components hidden in it and executes them, usually without saving them to the disk, to avoid detection. Droppers include images, games, or benign messages in their packages, which serve as a decoy to divert users’ attention from malicious activities. Downloaders are malware transporters that do not contain the actual malware file; however, they contain the link from where the actual Trojan can be downloaded. When a downloader is executed on the target machine, it connects back to the attacker’s server and downloads the intended Trojan on the victim’s machine. Droppers can easily evade firewalls; however, a downloader can be detected with the help of network analyzer tools.

Step 3: Employ a wrapper, such as IExpress Wizard, to help bind the Trojan executable to legitimate files for installation on the target system.

Step 4: Employ a crypter, such as The Attacker-Crypter, to encrypt the Trojan to evade detection by firewalls and IDS.

Step 5: Propagate the Trojan by implementing various methods such as sending it via overt and covert channels, exploit kits, emails, and instant messengers, thereby tricking users into downloading and executing it. An active Trojan can perform malicious activities such as irritating users with constant pop-ups, changing desktops, changing or deleting files, stealing data, and creating backdoors.

Step 6: Deploy the Trojan on the victim’s machine by executing the dropper or downloader software to disguise it. The deployed file contains wrapped and encrypted malware.

Step 7: Execute the damage routine. Most malware contain a damage routine that delivers payloads. Some payloads just display images or messages, whereas others can even delete files, reformat hard drives, or cause other damage. The damage routine can also include malware beaconing.
