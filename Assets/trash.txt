Defend Against NAC Evasion ▪ Develop comprehensive policies that clearly define access controls, authentication requirements, and remediation steps for noncompliant devices.
▪ Implement device profiling to identify and classify devices that attempt to connect to a network. This helps detect unauthorized devices or devices exhibiting unusual behavior.
▪ Ensure that NAC policies are enforced dynamically, allowing real-time adjustments based on changing security requirements or detected threats.
▪ Require multifactor authentication (MFA) to access sensitive network resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if a password is compromised.
▪ Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to resources based on user roles, thus reducing the risk of lateral movement by attackers.
▪ Segregate sensitive network resources into separate segments to limit the impact of NAC evasion incidents.
▪ Use virtual local area networks (VLANs) to restrict devices to specific network segments. ▪ Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in the NAC system.
▪ Use MAC address filtering to allow only authorized devices onto the network. ▪ Adopt a zero-trust approach , in which every device and user must be verified at every access point.
▪ Implement endpoint security solutions that provide antimalware, antiphishing, and firewall protection.
▪ Use RBAC to enforce the least privileged access principles. ▪ Share threat intelligence with the community to enhance collective defense against NAC evasion and other cyberthreats.
▪ Integrate NAC solutions with SIEM platforms to correlate NAC events with other security telemetry data, such as logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoint security solutions.
▪ Implement advanced authentication mechanisms such as certificate-based authentication or biometric authentication to enhance NAC security.
▪ Proactively hunt NAC evasion attempts by conducting effective threat hunting activities.
