DNS Rebinding Attack

Attackers use the DNS rebinding technique to bypass the same-origin policy’s security constraints, allowing the malicious web page to communicate with or make arbitrary requests to local domains. For instance, if a client is working for an organization, he/she mostly uses the internal or private network. Any externals resources cannot be accessed inside that private network due to the same-origin policy (SOP). Hence, attackers cannot directly communicate with the local network due to restrictions in the SOP. Therefore, they use the DNS rebinding technique to circumvent this SOP security implementation.

How DNS Rebinding Works
An attacker creates a malicious website with the domain name certifiedhacker.com and registers it with the DNS server controlled by him/her. Now, the attacker configures the DNS server to send DNS responses with very short TTL values to avoid caching of the responses. Then, the attacker begins his/her intended operation with the HTTP server that contains the malicious website http://certifiedhacker.com. When the victim opens the malicious website, the attacker’s DNS server sends the IP Address of the HTTP server that hosts the attacker-controlled website http://certifiedhacker.com. The web server responds with a page that runs JavaScript code in the victim’s browser. Then, the JavaScript code accesses the website on the domain http://certifiedhacker.com to get additional resources from http://certifiedhacker.com/secret.html. When the browser runs the JavaScript, it makes a DNS request for the domain (owing to the short TTL configuration), but the attacker-controlled DNS server responds with a new IP. For instance, if the attacker-controlled DNS server responds with the private or internal IP of xyz.com, the victim’s browser loads http://xyz.com/secret.html and not http://certifiedhacker.com/secret.html successfully by bypassing the SOP.
