Operational Security


▪ Insufficient Due Diligence

Ignorance of CSP’s cloud environment poses risks in operational responsibilities such as security, encryption, incident response, and more such problems as contractual issues, design, and architectural issues.

Countermeasures:
o Organizations that intend to move to a cloud must extensively research the risks, CSP due diligence, and possess capable resources.
o Ensure that all the employees are trained regarding security standards and resource maintenance.
o Ensure that the CSP maintains an incident response plan (IRP) by employing appropriate teams for implementing corresponding security measures during any incident.
o Maintain proper communication with the CSP regarding disaster recovery plans, encryption strategies, and security policies.
o Reinforce stringent security policies to be followed in governance with the top-level management of the company.


▪ Shared Technology Issues

IaaS vendors share the infrastructure to deliver services in a scalable way. Most underlying infrastructure components (e.g., GPU, CPU caches) do not offer substantial isolation properties in a multi-tenant environment. This enables attackers to attack other machines if they can exploit vulnerabilities in one client’s applications. To address this gap, virtualization hypervisors mediate access between guest OSs and the physical resources that might contain loopholes allowing hackers to gain unauthorized control over the underlying platforms.

Countermeasures:
o Implement security best practices for installation/configuration.
o Monitor the environment for unauthorized changes/activity.
o Promote secure authentication and access control for administrative access and operations.
o Enforce service level agreements for patching and vulnerability remediation.
o Conduct vulnerability scanning and configuration audits.
o Implement strict security at every level of the cloud infrastructure, application, and services.
o Utilize perimeter, host-based, and per-tenant firewalls to isolate traffic for each user in the cloud environment.
o Set the appropriate file permissions to ensure that only users or owners have access to the files.


▪ Unknown Risk Profile

Software updates, threat analysis, intrusion detection, security practices, and various other components determine the security posture of an organization. Client organizations are unable to get a clear picture of internal security procedures, security compliance, configuration hardening, patching, auditing and logging, etc. because they are less involved with hardware and software ownership and maintenance in the cloud. However, organizations must be aware of issues such as internal security procedures, security compliance, configuration hardening, patching, and auditing and logging.

Countermeasures:
o Disclosure of applicable logs and data to customers
o Partial/full disclosure of infrastructure details (e.g., patch levels, firewalls)
o Monitoring and alerting of necessary information


▪ Unsynchronized System Clocks

The failure of synchronizing clocks at the end systems can affect the working of automated tasks. For example, if the cloud computing devices do not have synchronized or matched times, then timestamp inaccuracy constitutes the network administrator unable to analyze the log files for any malicious activity accurately. Unsynchronized clocks can cause various other problems; e.g., in case of money transactions or database backups, the mismatched timestamp may result in significant problems or discrepancies.

Countermeasures:
o Use clock synchronization solutions, such as a network time protocol (NTP).
o Install a time server within the organization firewall to minimize threats from the outside and maximize the time accuracy on the network.
o A network time system can also be used to synchronize clocks with an enterprise network server.


▪ Inadequate Infrastructure Design and Planning

An agreement between the CSP and customer states the quality of service that the CSP offers, such as downtime, physical and network-based redundancies, standard data backup and restore processes, and availability periods. At times, CSPs may not satisfy the rapid rise in demand owing to a shortage of computing resources and/or poor network design (e.g., traffic flows through a single point, even though the necessary hardware is available), giving rise to unacceptable network latency or inability to meet agreed service levels.

Countermeasures:
o Forecast the demand and accordingly prepare sufficient infrastructure.
o Rely on workloads’ reliability and uptime requirements to plan the usage of the cloud.


▪ Conflicts between Client Hardening Procedures and Cloud Environment

Certain client hardening procedures may conflict with a CSP environment, making implementation by the client impossible. Because a cloud is a multi-tenant environment, the colocation of many customers indeed causes conflicts for the cloud providers, as communication security requirements are likely to diverge between customers.
Countermeasures:
o Set a clear segregation of responsibilities to define the minimum actions customers must undertake.
o Ensure that the client organization has proper visibility of its workload, data, and cloud accounts that are affected by the shadow IT problem.
o Employ cloud VAPT testing periodically at both the client side and CSP side.


▪ Cloud Provider Acquisition

CSP acquisition may increase the probability of tactical shift and affect non-binding agreements at risk. This could pose a challenge in handling security requirements.

Countermeasures:
o Be tactful when choosing a cloud provider; prefer a reputed and popular CSP to eliminate risk.
o Verify the data policies offered by CSPs carefully.
o Review the security capabilities of the CSP.
o Ensure that the service-level agreements (SLAs) provide information about mission objectives, success measures, data collection, and measures.


▪ Network Management Failure

Poor network management leads to network congestion, misconnection, misconfiguration, lack of resource isolation, etc., which affect services and security.

Countermeasures:
o Ensure that an adequate security policy is implemented.
o Use proactive network management techniques.
o Keep updating new technologies and analyze what might work better for your organization.
o Make sure that the network design and system configurations follow IT governance and matches the service and capacity requirements of the organization.
o Implement stringent network monitoring and analysis for the traffic from all types of secured and unsecured links.
o Ensure that all the network traffic between Wi-Fi and the enterprise network is communicated through a secured VPN network.
o Use cloud network security monitoring tools for better visibility on the enterprise cloud network deployed out of the network perimeter.
