MITRE ATT&CK for ICS

Source: https://attack.mitre.org

MITRE ATT&CK for ICS can be used as a knowledge base by ICS security teams or vendors to understand an attacker’s actions against OT systems and to develop a defense system to prevent them. It also helps security teams illustrate and characterize the behavior of an attacker after any compromise.

MITRE ATT&CK for ICS features different tactics, which are discussed below.

▪ Initial Access

It refers to the methods or techniques that an attacker can employ to establish initial access within the targeted ICS environment. An attacker can compromise different OT assets, websites, IT resources, and other external services to gain access to the ICS environment. Listed below are some of the techniques used by an attacker to gain initial access:
o Drive-by compromise: An attacker can gain access to the OT system by exploiting the target user’s web browser by tricking them into visiting a compromised website during a normal browsing session.
o Exploiting a public-facing software application: An attacker exploits the known vulnerabilities of an Internet-facing application to gain access to an OT network. Such applications can be used for remote monitoring and management.
o Exploiting remote services: An attacker can manipulate known vulnerabilities of an application by leveraging error messages generated by the OS, program, or the kernel to perform further attacks on the remote services.

Listed below are some of the additional techniques used by attackers to gain initial access to an ICS environment:
o External remote services o Internet-accessible devices o Remote services
o Replication through removable media
o Rogue master



▪ Execution

Execution refers to an attacker’s attempt to execute malicious code, manipulate data, or perform other system functions through illegitimate approaches. Attackers use different techniques to run malicious code within a device or asset in an ICT environment. Some of the techniques associated with this stage are as follows:

o Changing the operating mode: An attacker gains additional access to various OT functionalities by manipulating the operating modes of a controller within the infrastructure, e.g., program download.
o Command-line interface (CLI): An attacker uses the CLI to run various malicious commands and communicate with an OT system. It allows them to install and run different malicious programs and perform malicious operations without being detected.
