Sequential Change-Point Detection
• Change-point detection algorithms isolate changes in network traffic statistics and in the traffic flow rate caused by attacks
• The algorithms filter the target traffic data by address, port, or protocol and store the resultant flow as a time series
• The sequential change-point detection technique uses the Cusum algorithm to identify and locate DoS attacks
• This technique can also be used to identify the typical scanning activities of network worms

Wavelet-Based Signal Analysis
• Wavelet analysis describes an input signal in terms of spectral components
• Analyzing each spectral window’s energy determines the presence of anomalies
• Wavelet-based signal analysis filters out the anomalous traffic flow input signals from background noise
