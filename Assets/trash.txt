Techniques for IDS Evasion 

Other Techniques for IDS

Evasion IDS that provide an extra layer of security to the organization’s infrastructure are interesting targets for attackers. Attackers implement various IDS evasion techniques to bypass such security mechanisms and compromise the infrastructure. IDS evasion is the process of modifying attacks to fool the IDS/IPS into interpreting that the traffic is legitimate and thus prevent the IDS from triggering an alert. Many IDS evasion techniques can perform IDS evasion in different and effective ways.

Some IDS evasion techniques are as follows: 
▪ Insertion Attack 
▪ Evasion 
▪ DoS Attack 
▪ Obfuscating 
▪ False Positive Generation 
▪ Session Splicing 
▪ Unicode Evasion 
▪ Fragmentation Attack 
▪ Time-To-Live Attacks 
▪ Urgency Flag
▪ Invalid RST Packets 
▪ Polymorphic Shellcode 
▪ ASCII Shellcode 
▪ Application-Layer Attacks 
▪ Desynchronization 
▪ Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)
▪ Encryption 
▪ Flooding
