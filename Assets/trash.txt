Implementation of certain security measures such as password change policy, information sharing policy, access privileges, unique user identification, and centralized security, prove to be beneficial.

Like other techniques, social engineering does not deal with network security issues; instead, it deals with the psychological manipulation of a human being to extract desired information.

The following are reasons why social engineering continues to be effective:
▪ Despite various security policies, preventing social engineering is a challenge because human beings are most susceptible to variation.
▪ It is challenging to detect social engineering attempts. Social engineering is the art and science of manipulating people into divulging information.
▪ No method guarantees complete security from social engineering attacks.
▪ No specific hardware or software is available to safeguard against social engineering attacks.
▪ This approach is relatively cheap (or free) and easy to implemen
