Web Application Firewall (WAF)

    Purpose: Protects web applications from attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
    Features:
        Filters HTTP/(.
        Enforces application-specific security rules.


Network Access Control (NAC)

    Purpose: Ensures that only authorized and compliant devices can access the network.
    Features:
        Device authentication before granting access.
        Quarantines non-compliant devices for remediation.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

    Purpose: Centralized logging and analysis of security events across the organization.
    Features:
        Aggregates logs from multiple devices.
        Correlates events to identify potential security incidents.
        Provides dashboards for monitoring and alerting.


Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

    Purpose: An advanced version of a firewall with integrated features.
    Features:
        Deep packet inspection.
        Application awareness and control.
        Integrated IDS/IPS functionality.

Keyscan_dump command to sniff user keystrokes on the target machine. This command dumps all the sniffed keystrokes and displays them on the console.
Use the keyscan_stop command to stop sniffing keystrokes.
Attackers can also automate the entire sniffing and data dumping process using the Metasploit lockout_keylogger exploit.
Use user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) tools to detect user behavior anomalies indicating attempts to cover tracks.

Attackers can use AI-based malware to perform various activities such as data infiltration, data theft, espionage, resource exploitation and disrupt the entire environment. Popular variants of AI-based malware include BlackMamba, WormGPT, FraudGPT, Stuxnet, DeepLocker, and Mylobott.

• YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym) is a powerful tool used for identifying and classifying malware samples
•
It works by allowing users to create rules that describe patterns of interest in files, which can include specific strings, binary sequences, or a combination of characteristics that typically appear in malware
Structure of YARA rules:
Rule Header: Includes the rule's name and optional tags Metadata: Includes any key-value pairs that provide additional information about the rule String: Defines the strings to search for in the files Condition: Defines the logic that must be met for the rule to match
