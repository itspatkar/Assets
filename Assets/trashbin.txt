▪ Hidden content discovery: Footprinting also allows attackers to extract content and functionality that is not directly linked to or reachable from the main visible content.

▪ Load balancers detection: Attackers can detect load balancers of the target organization along with their real IP addresses to identify servers exposed over the Internet.

▪ Web app technologies detection: Attackers can detect the underlying technologies used to build the web application before initiating the actual attack.

▪ WebSocket enumeration: While footprinting the web infrastructure, attackers can identify the WebSocket servers running on the target site.
