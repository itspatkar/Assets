                <p>A node is a connection point inside a network that can receive, send, create, or store data. Each node requires you to provide some form of identification to receive access, like an IP address. A node is essentially any network device that can recognize, process, and transmit information to any other network node.</p>

                    <li>A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, secured from tampering and revision.</li>
                    <li>Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.</li>
                    <li>A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks.</li>
                    <li>Once recorded, information cannot be altered without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <h5>&bull; Genesis Block :</h5>
                    <p>The Genesis Block, also known as Block 0, is the very first block upon which additional blocks in a blockchain are added. It is effectively the ancestor that every other block can trace its lineage back to since every block references the one preceding it. The Genesis Block is a critical element of a blockchain network because it serves as the foundation for the entire network.</p>

                <div>
                    <h5>&bull; Blockchain Explorer :</h5>
                    <p>A blockchain explorer is a platform that allows people to search and navigate a blockchain. They're not necessary for using the blockchain. However, they offer a valuable service to those who wish to inspect a blockchain in detail. You can view transactions on the blockchain, smart contract code, account balances, and more.</p>
