                <h4 class="heading"># Internet</h4>
                <p>The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that use standardized communication protocols to exchange data and information. For effective communication and organization on a network, devices need to have clear identification and be recognizable by others which is typically occurs through unique identifiers assigned to each device, such as IP addresses or MAC addresses. These identifiers enable devices to send and receive data, facilitating communication and maintaining order within the network.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>IP Address :</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An IP (or Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.</li>
                            <li>It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network.</li>
                            <li>It is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting.</li>
                            <li>A device's IP address can be changed, but two devices cannot have the same IP address within the same network.</li>
                            <li>An IP address is of two types: public or private. A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices on a local network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>MAC Address :</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication at the data link layer of a network segment. It serves as a hardware address that distinguishes one device from another on a network.</li>
                            <li>The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by a colon.</li>
                            <li>The first six characters represent the vendor/company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.</li>
                            <li>MAC addresses can be faked or spoofed in a process known as spoofing. This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify another using its MAC address.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Port Address :</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>***</li>

                <h4 class="heading"># Networking Nodes</h4>
                <p>A node in a network is a point where data can be received, sent, created, or stored. It needs identification like an IP address for access and can be any device that processes and shares information with other nodes.</p>
