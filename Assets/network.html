                <h4 class="heading"># Internet</h4>
                <p>The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that use standardized communication protocols to exchange data and information. For effective communication and organization on a network, devices need to have clear identification and be recognizable by others which is typically occurs through unique identifiers assigned to each device, such as IP addresses or MAC addresses. These identifiers enable devices to send and receive data, facilitating communication and maintaining order within the network.</p>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li>
                        <h5>IP Address :</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An IP (or Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.</li>
                            <li>It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network.</li>
                            <li>It is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting.</li>
                            <li>A device's IP address can be changed, but two devices cannot have the same IP address within the same network.</li>
                            <li>An IP address is of two types: public or private. A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices on a local network.</li>
                            <li><b>Ping :</b> The <code>ping</code> command is used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>MAC Address :</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication at the data link layer of a network segment. It serves as a hardware address that distinguishes one device from another on a network.</li>
                            <li>The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by a colon.</li>
                            <li>The first six characters represent the vendor/company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.</li>
                            <li>MAC addresses can be faked or spoofed in a process known as spoofing. This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify another using its MAC address.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Port Address :</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A port address is a numeric value used to uniquely identify different communication endpoints in a network.</li>
                            <li>In a node, multiple processes are running, and data that is sent or received must reach the right process.</li>
                            <li>Every process in the node is uniquely identified using a port number, which is used to route data packets to the correct destination.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sections" id="url">
                <h4 class="heading"># URL</h4>
                <p>A URL (or Uniform Resource Locator) is predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet.</p>
                <h6>Ex :</h6>
                <div class="code-box">http://user:password@example.com:80/view?id=1#task2</div>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li><b>Scheme (<code>http</code>) :</b> This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP.</li>
                    <li><b>User (<code>user:password</code>) :</b> Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.</li>
                    <li><b>Host (<code>example.com</code>) :</b> The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.</li>
                    <li><b>Port (<code>80</code>) :</b> The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.</li>
                    <li><b>Path (<code>/view</code>) :</b> The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.</li>
                    <li><b>Query String (<code>/view?id=1</code>) :</b> Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path.</li>
                    <li><b>Fragment (<code>#task2</code>) :</b> This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sections" id="dns">
                <h4 class="heading"># DNS</h4>
                <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as <code>192.168.1.1</code> (in IPv4).</p>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li><b>Domain Name Resolution :</b> When a domain name is entered into a web browser, the device first checks its local DNS cache to see if the corresponding IP address exists. If not, it sends a request to a DNS server.</li>
                    <li><b>DNS Server Lookup :</b> The device sends a query to a DNS server, provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). If the DNS server has the requested information in its cache, it returns the IP address to the device. If not, it queries other DNS servers until it finds the information or determines that it doesn't exist.</li>
                    <li><b>Response :</b> Once the DNS server has the IP address corresponding to the requested domain name, it sends that information back to the device. The device can then connect to the server hosting the requested website and access the website.</li>
                    <li><b>NSLookup :</b> The <code>nslookup</code> is used for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and DNS records. It stands for Name Server Lookup.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Domain Hierarchy :</b> Domain Hierarchy refers to the structure and organization of domain names within the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>

                        <ul>

                <h4 class="heading"># Networking Nodes</h4>
                <p>A node in a network is a point where data can be received, sent, created, or stored. It needs identification like an IP address for access and can be any device that processes and shares information with other nodes.</p>
