				- Identify the offset: Attackers use Metasploit's pattern_create and pattern_offset tools to identify the offset and exact location where the EIP register is being overwritten
				- Overwrite the EIP register: Overwriting the EIP identifies whether a register can be controlled and overwritten with malicious shellcode
				- Identify bad characters: Before injecting the shellcode into the EIP register, attackers identify bad characters that may cause issues in the shellcode
				- Identify the right module: Identify the right module of a vulnerable server that lacks memory protection
				- Generate shellcode: Generate the shellcode (with the msfvenom command) and inject it into the EIP register to gain shell access to the target vulnerable server
				- Gain root access
		- Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) Attack

## Privilege Escalation

- Types of Privilege Escalation
	- Horizontal Privilege Escalation (Same Level Privileges)
	- Vertical Privilege Escalation (Elevation of Privileges)
- Methods of Privilege Escalation
	- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Vulnerabilities
	- Privilege Escalation Using DLL (Dynamic Link Library) Hijacking - Windows:
		- Spartacus : An automated DLL/COM hijacking toolkit that analyzes SysInternals Process Monitor logs to identify, exploit, and generate payloads for DLL and COM hijacking vulnerabilities
		- DLLirant : Tool to automatize the DLL Hijacking and DLL Proxying researches on a specified binary 
		- ImpulsiveDLLHijack : Automates the discovery and exploitation of DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in target binaries, with the hijacked paths identified later being weaponized during Red Team operations to evade EDR systems
		- PowerSploit : PowerShell Post-Exploitation Framework that is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that aid penetration testers during all phases of an assessment
	- Privilege Escalation Using Dylib (dynamic library) Hijacking - MacOS:
		- Dylib Hijack Scanner : Scans a computer for applications that are either susceptible to dylib hijacking or have already been hijacked
	- Privilege Escalation Using Spectre and Meltdown Vulnerabilities:
		- Spectre and Meltdown are vulnerabilities found in the design of modern processor chips (AMD, ARM, and Intel). These vulnerabilities arise from performance and CPU optimizations in processors, such as branch prediction, out-of-order execution, caching, and speculative execution. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and steal sensitive system information, such as credentials and secret keys stored in the application's memory, to escalate privileges.
		- Spectre Vulnerability: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read adjacent memory locations of a process, accessing unauthorized information, and may even gain access to kernel memory or perform web-based attacks using JavaScript.
		- Meltdown Vulnerability: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges by forcing an unprivileged process to read adjacent memory locations, such as kernel and physical memory, thereby revealing critical system information like credentials and private keys.
	- Privilege Escalation Using Named Pipe Impersonation - Windows:
		- In Windows OS, named pipes are used to facilitate legitimate communication between running processes.
		- In this technique, messages are exchanged between processes using a file. For example, if process A wants to send a message to process B, it writes the message to a file, and process B reads the message from that file.
	- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Misconfigured Services - Windows:
		- Unquoted Service Paths: In Windows, services with unquoted executable paths can be exploited by attackers to elevate privileges when running under SYSTEM privileges.
		- Service Object Permissions: Misconfigured service permissions can allow attackers to modify or reconfigure service attributes, add users to the administrator group, and elevate privileges.
		- Unattended Installs: Unattended installation information, such as configuration settings used during the installation process, is stored in the Unattend.xml file and can be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges.
		- Modifiable Registry Autoruns and Configurations: Modifying certain registry entries that control the execution of programs, often exploiting weak or misconfigured permissions to gain higher privileges, execute malicious code, or persist on the system.
	- Pivoting and Relaying to Hack External Machines:
		- Pivoting and relaying are techniques used to gather detailed information about a target network after successfully compromising a target system. The compromised system acts as a bridge, enabling attackers to penetrate deeper into the target network and access other systems and resources that would otherwise be inaccessible from the attacking system.
		- Pivoting: Attackers use the pivoting technique to compromise a system, gain remote shell access on it, and further bypass the firewall to pivot via the compromised system to access other vulnerable systems in the network.
		- Relaying: Attackers use the relaying technique to access resources present on other systems via the compromised system in such a way that the requests to access the resources are coming from the initially compromised system.
	- Privilege Escalation Using Misconfigured NFS - Windows:
		- Attackers attempt to enumerate a misconfigured Network File System (NFS) to exploit it and gain root-level access to a remote server, as such misconfigurations allow them to escalate privileges from a regular or low-privileged user account.
	- Privilege Escalation by Bypassing User Account Control (UAC):
		- When attackers fail to escalate privileges with a simple payload, they attempt to evade Windows security features like UAC and exploit certain Windows applications to gain system-level access without triggering a UAC notification, even when UAC protection is enabled.
		- Techniques to Bypassing UAC Protection Using Metasploit:
			- Bypassing UAC Protection - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
			- Through FodHelper Registry Key - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
			- Through Eventvwr Registry Key - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
			- Through COM Handler Hijacking - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_comhijack
			- Via Memory Injection - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
	- Privilege Escalation by Abusing Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts:
		- Attackers exploit boot or logon initialization scripts to escalate privileges or maintain persistence on a target system. These scripts also enable attackers to perform various administrative tasks, allowing them to execute other programs on the system.
		- Windows Logon Script : Attackers establish persistence and escalate privileges on a system by embedding the path to their script in the registry key (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript)
		- Mac Logon Script : In macOS, logon scripts are known as login hooks and allow attackers to establish persistence on a system, as they are executed automatically during system login. Attackers exploit these hooks to inject a malicious payload, elevate privileges, and maintain persistence.
		- Network Logon Scripts : Network logon scripts are assigned through Active Directory or GPOs. Attackers exploit these scripts to obtain local or administrator credentials, depending on the access configuration.
		- RC Scripts : Attackers exploit RC scripts by embedding a malicious binary, shell, or path in RC scripts such as rc.common or rc.local on Unix-based systems to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.
		- Startup Items : Attackers create malicious files or folders within the /Library/StartupItems directory to maintain persistence. Startup items are executed during bootup with root-level privileges.
	- Privilege Escalation by Modifying Domain Policy:
		- The domain policy consists of configuration settings that can be applied between domains in a forest environment. Attackers modify domain settings by altering group policies and trust relationships between domains. They may also deploy a fake domain controller to maintain a foothold and escalate privileges.
		- Group Policy Modification:
			- Group policies manage resources and configuration settings such as security options, registry keys, and domain members. By default, all user accounts have read access to GPOs, while write access is restricted to specific users or groups within the domain.
			- Attackers exploit the path <DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\ to access and modify domain group policies, enabling activities like creating new accounts, disabling or modifying internal tools, transferring ingress tools, executing unwanted services, and extracting passwords in plaintext.
			- At <GPO_PATH>\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml, attackers can modify the file to create a malicious scheduled task or job using scripts like New-GPOImmediateTask.
			- At <GPO_PATH>\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf, attackers may alter user rights (e.g., SeEnableDelegationPrivilege) to create a backdoor and then control the user account to modify group policy settings.`
		- Domain Trust Modification:
			- Domain trust objects provide information such as credentials, accounts, and authentication and authorization mechanisms used by domains. C:\Windows\system32>nltest /domain_trusts
			- Attackers use this utility to gather information about trusted domains and leverage it to add a domain trust or modify existing trust settings, enabling privilege escalation through Kerberoasting and pass-the-ticket attacks.
	- Retrieving Password Hashes of Other Domain Controllers Using DCSync Attack:
		- A domain controller (DC) in a Windows environment securely validates user requests, manages user accounts, provides authentication, and enforces domain security policies. Directory replication ensures data consistency across DCs, so updates like password changes are reflected across all controllers.
		- The DCSync attack targets selective DCs. Attackers with privileged access and domain replication rights use replication protocols to create a virtual DC. This allows them to request and extract sensitive data, such as NTLM password hashes. With this information, attackers can perform golden ticket attacks, account manipulation, LOTL attacks, and deploy ransomware.
		- Attackers use Mimikatz to perform DCSync attacks. Mimikatz includes a DCSync command that employs the Microsoft Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR) to mimic the behavior of a legitimate domain controller (DC).
		- Retrieve the NTLM password hashes of an administrator account: mimikatz “lsadump::dcsync /domain:(domain name) /user:Administrator”
	- Privilege Escalation by Abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS):
		- Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) is commonly deployed across the AD environment to manage certificates for applications, users, systems, and other entities within the network.
		- Misconfigured ADCS templates can create critical vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit for malicious activities, such as stealing credentials, escalating privileges, and establishing persistence.
		- Attackers can use tools like Certipy to identify and exploit misconfigured ADCS templates.
		- Certipy : Certipy is an offensive tool used for enumerating and exploiting Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS).
	- Other Privilege Escalation Techniques:
		- Access Token Manipulation:
			- In Windows operating systems, access tokens determine the security context of a process or thread, including the user's identity and privileges. After a user is authenticated, the system generates an access token, which is used by every process the user executes. The system verifies the access token when a process accesses a secured object.
			- Any Windows user can modify these access tokens, making the process appear to belong to a different user than the one who started it, thus adopting the new token's security context. For example, administrators typically log in as normal users and use the "runas" command to execute tools with elevated privileges. Attackers can exploit this to access other users' tokens or generate spoofed tokens, escalating privileges and performing malicious actions while evading detection.
		- Parent PID Spoofing:
			- Attackers attempt to bypass internal security mechanisms and escalate privileges by spoofing the parent process ID (PPID) of a newly created process. New processes typically inherit their PPID from their parent unless explicitly specified. This can be done by providing a PPID for the new process via the CreateProcess API. The API call includes specific arguments that determine which PPID to use.
			- The PPID can be set to that of system processes like svchost.exe or consent.exe, which are associated with Windows User Account Control (UAC). Attackers exploit these methods to bypass security restrictions on process spawning, evade tools that analyze parent-child relationships, and maintain persistence for privilege escalation.
		- Application Shimming:
			- Windows operating systems use the Windows Application Compatibility Framework, which includes "shims," to ensure compatibility between older and newer versions. For example, shimming allows programs designed for Windows XP to run on Windows 11. Shims act as a buffer between the program and the OS, checking if the program requires access to the shim database and using API hooking to redirect code for compatibility.
			- Shims installed by the default Windows installer (sbinst.exe) are stored at %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and in the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\InstalledSDB. Running in user mode, shims can't modify the kernel but can be exploited to bypass UAC, inject malicious DLLs, capture memory addresses, and more. Attackers use these to disable Windows Defender, escalate privileges, install backdoors, and perform other malicious activities.
		- Filesystem Permission Weakness:
			- Many processes in Windows operating systems automatically execute binaries as part of their functionality or to perform specific actions. If the filesystem permissions for these binaries are misconfigured, an attacker can replace the legitimate binary with a malicious one, and the process will execute it.
			- If the process running the binary has elevated permissions, the malicious binary will also execute with those higher privileges, potentially including SYSTEM privileges. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones, enabling privilege escalation. This technique is often used to manipulate Windows service binaries and self-extracting installers.
		- Path Interception:
			- Path interception is a technique where an attacker places a malicious executable in a specific path, causing the application to execute it instead of the legitimate target. Attackers can exploit various flaws or misconfigurations to perform path interception, such as unquoted paths (e.g., service paths and shortcut paths), misconfigured path environment variables, and search order hijacking.
		- Abusing Accessibility Features:
			- Attackers can establish persistence and escalate privileges by embedding and executing malicious code within Windows accessibility features. These features can be activated using key combinations even before a user logs into the system, allowing attackers to manipulate them and gain backdoor access without needing to log in.
			- In a Windows environment, these programs are typically stored in C:\Windows\System32\ and can be triggered by pressing specific keys during system reboot. Attackers can escalate privileges by replacing one of the accessibility features with cmd.exe or by modifying registry entries to launch malicious binaries when the key combination is pressed at the login screen. This technique enables attackers to gain system-level access.
			- Accessibility features abused by attackers:
				- On-screen keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
				- Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
				- Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
				- Display switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
				- App switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe
				- Sticky keys: C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
		- SID-History Injection:
			- In Windows, a Security Identifier (SID) is a unique value assigned to each user and group account by the domain controller (DC) at the time of creation. Active Directory (AD) accounts can store multiple SID values in the SID-history attribute, which is used when migrating a user from one domain to another.
			- Attackers exploit this feature by injecting the SID of an administrator or equivalent account with higher privileges into the compromised user account's SID-history attribute. This injection can elevate the user's privileges, allowing the attacker to access restricted resources or remote systems. Attackers can also move laterally within the domain by using further techniques, such as accessing remote services, SMB/Windows admin shares, or Windows Remote Management.
		- COM Hijacking:
			- The Component Object Model (COM) is an interface framework in Windows environments that allows one software component to interact with another without being aware of its actual implementation. Attackers exploit COM objects by hijacking valid references and replacing them with their own, allowing them to infect the target system and achieve persistence.
			- This process involves modifying or replacing object references with malicious content in the Windows Registry. When a user executes the commonly used object, the malicious code is automatically triggered, enabling the attacker to maintain persistence and potentially escalate privileges associated with the object.
			- COM hijacking techniques:
				- Exploiting the registry loading process by creating a malicious user object under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\ registry key, which is loaded by the system before the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\ registry key.
				- Interchanging legitimate DLLs or executable names with malicious payloads, causing the payloads to execute when the legitimate DLLs or executables are run.
				- Exploiting orphaned requests made by system components that are not yet defined in the registry, creating malicious COM objects for those requests in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry and mapping them to malicious payloads hidden in the file system.
		- Scheduled Tasks in Windows:
			- Scheduled tasks allow users to automate routine tasks on a computer. Windows includes utilities such as at and schtasks. A user with administrator privileges can use these utilities, along with Task Scheduler, to schedule programs or scripts to run at specific dates and times. If the user provides proper authentication, they can also schedule tasks remotely using Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
			- Attackers can exploit this technique to execute malicious programs at system startup, maintain persistence, perform remote execution, escalate privileges, etc.
		- Scheduled Tasks in Linux:
			- Linux utilizes cron or crond, an instruction-based utility, for automating task scheduling. Attackers exploit this utility to trigger malicious payloads when a specific task is scheduled for execution. The scheduler allows users with administrator privileges to configure cron jobs and execute them at specified times. cron runs commands from the crontab file, typically located at /etc/crontab.
			- Attackers can escalate privileges by modifying scripts executed by cron in /etc/crontab. By altering these scripts, attackers can ensure malicious code is executed automatically during system reboot, potentially gaining root privileges.
