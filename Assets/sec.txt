				- Identify the offset: Attackers use Metasploit's pattern_create and pattern_offset tools to identify the offset and exact location where the EIP register is being overwritten
				- Overwrite the EIP register: Overwriting the EIP identifies whether a register can be controlled and overwritten with malicious shellcode
				- Identify bad characters: Before injecting the shellcode into the EIP register, attackers identify bad characters that may cause issues in the shellcode
				- Identify the right module: Identify the right module of a vulnerable server that lacks memory protection
				- Generate shellcode: Generate the shellcode (with the msfvenom command) and inject it into the EIP register to gain shell access to the target vulnerable server
				- Gain root access

## Privilege Escalation

- Types of Privilege Escalation
	- Horizontal Privilege Escalation (Same Level Privileges)
	- Vertical Privilege Escalation (Elevation of Privileges)
- Methods of Privilege Escalation
	- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Vulnerabilities
	- Privilege Escalation Using DLL (Dynamic Link Library) Hijacking - Windows:
		- Spartacus : An automated DLL/COM hijacking toolkit that analyzes SysInternals Process Monitor logs to identify, exploit, and generate payloads for DLL and COM hijacking vulnerabilities
		- DLLirant : Tool to automatize the DLL Hijacking and DLL Proxying researches on a specified binary 
		- ImpulsiveDLLHijack : Automates the discovery and exploitation of DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in target binaries, with the hijacked paths identified later being weaponized during Red Team operations to evade EDR systems
		- PowerSploit : PowerShell Post-Exploitation Framework that is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that aid penetration testers during all phases of an assessment
	- Privilege Escalation Using Dylib (dynamic library) Hijacking - MacOS:
		- Dylib Hijack Scanner : Scans a computer for applications that are either susceptible to dylib hijacking or have already been hijacked
	- Privilege Escalation Using Spectre and Meltdown Vulnerabilities:
		- Spectre and Meltdown are vulnerabilities found in the design of modern processor chips (AMD, ARM, and Intel). These vulnerabilities arise from performance and CPU optimizations in processors, such as branch prediction, out-of-order execution, caching, and speculative execution. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and steal sensitive system information, such as credentials and secret keys stored in the application's memory, to escalate privileges.
		- Spectre Vulnerability: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read adjacent memory locations of a process, accessing unauthorized information, and may even gain access to kernel memory or perform web-based attacks using JavaScript.
		- Meltdown Vulnerability: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges by forcing an unprivileged process to read adjacent memory locations, such as kernel and physical memory, thereby revealing critical system information like credentials and private keys.
	- Privilege Escalation Using Named Pipe Impersonation - Windows:
		- In Windows OS, named pipes are used to facilitate legitimate communication between running processes.
		- In this technique, messages are exchanged between processes using a file. For example, if process A wants to send a message to process B, it writes the message to a file, and process B reads the message from that file.
	- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Misconfigured Services - Windows:
		- Unquoted Service Paths: In Windows, services with unquoted executable paths can be exploited by attackers to elevate privileges when running under SYSTEM privileges.
		- Service Object Permissions: Misconfigured service permissions can allow attackers to modify or reconfigure service attributes, add users to the administrator group, and elevate privileges.
		- Unattended Installs: Unattended installation information, such as configuration settings used during the installation process, is stored in the Unattend.xml file and can be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges.
		- Modifiable Registry Autoruns and Configurations: Modifying certain registry entries that control the execution of programs, often exploiting weak or misconfigured permissions to gain higher privileges, execute malicious code, or persist on the system.
	- Pivoting and Relaying to Hack External Machines:
		- Pivoting and relaying are techniques used to gather detailed information about a target network after successfully compromising a target system. The compromised system acts as a bridge, enabling attackers to penetrate deeper into the target network and access other systems and resources that would otherwise be inaccessible from the attacking system.
		- Pivoting: Attackers use the pivoting technique to compromise a system, gain remote shell access on it, and further bypass the firewall to pivot via the compromised system to access other vulnerable systems in the network.
		- Relaying: Attackers use the relaying technique to access resources present on other systems via the compromised system in such a way that the requests to access the resources are coming from the initially compromised system.
	- Privilege Escalation Using Misconfigured NFS - Windows:
		- Attackers attempt to enumerate a misconfigured Network File System (NFS) to exploit it and gain root-level access to a remote server, as such misconfigurations allow them to escalate privileges from a regular or low-privileged user account.
	- Privilege Escalation by Bypassing User Account Control (UAC):
		- When attackers fail to escalate privileges with a simple payload, they attempt to evade Windows security features like UAC and exploit certain Windows applications to gain system-level access without triggering a UAC notification, even when UAC protection is enabled.
		- Techniques to Bypassing UAC Protection Using Metasploit:
			- Bypassing UAC Protection - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
			- Through FodHelper Registry Key - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
			- Through Eventvwr Registry Key - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
			- Through COM Handler Hijacking - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_comhijack
			- Via Memory Injection - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
	- Privilege Escalation by Abusing Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts:
		- Attackers exploit boot or logon initialization scripts to escalate privileges or maintain persistence on a target system. These scripts also enable attackers to perform various administrative tasks, allowing them to execute other programs on the system.
		- Windows Logon Script : Attackers establish persistence and escalate privileges on a system by embedding the path to their script in the registry key (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript)
		- Mac Logon Script : In macOS, logon scripts are known as login hooks and allow attackers to establish persistence on a system, as they are executed automatically during system login. Attackers exploit these hooks to inject a malicious payload, elevate privileges, and maintain persistence.
		- Network Logon Scripts : Network logon scripts are assigned through Active Directory or GPOs. Attackers exploit these scripts to obtain local or administrator credentials, depending on the access configuration.
		- RC Scripts : Attackers exploit RC scripts by embedding a malicious binary, shell, or path in RC scripts such as rc.common or rc.local on Unix-based systems to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.
		- Startup Items : Attackers create malicious files or folders within the /Library/StartupItems directory to maintain persistence. Startup items are executed during bootup with root-level privileges.
	- Privilege Escalation by Modifying Domain Policy:
		- The domain policy consists of configuration settings that can be applied between domains in a forest environment. Attackers modify domain settings by altering group policies and trust relationships between domains. They may also deploy a fake domain controller to maintain a foothold and escalate privileges.
		- Group Policy Modification:
			- Group policies manage resources and configuration settings such as security options, registry keys, and domain members. By default, all user accounts have read access to GPOs, while write access is restricted to specific users or groups within the domain.
			- Attackers exploit the path <DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\ to access and modify domain group policies, enabling activities like creating new accounts, disabling or modifying internal tools, transferring ingress tools, executing unwanted services, and extracting passwords in plaintext.
			- At <GPO_PATH>\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml, attackers can modify the file to create a malicious scheduled task or job using scripts like New-GPOImmediateTask.
			- At <GPO_PATH>\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf, attackers may alter user rights (e.g., SeEnableDelegationPrivilege) to create a backdoor and then control the user account to modify group policy settings.`
		- Domain Trust Modification:
			- Domain trust objects provide information such as credentials, accounts, and authentication and authorization mechanisms used by domains. C:\Windows\system32>nltest /domain_trusts
			- Attackers use this utility to gather information about trusted domains and leverage it to add a domain trust or modify existing trust settings, enabling privilege escalation through Kerberoasting and pass-the-ticket attacks.
	- Retrieving Password Hashes of Other Domain Controllers Using DCSync Attack:
		- A domain controller (DC) in a Windows environment securely validates user requests, manages user accounts, provides authentication, and enforces domain security policies. Directory replication ensures data consistency across DCs, so updates like password changes are reflected across all controllers.
		- The DCSync attack targets selective DCs. Attackers with privileged access and domain replication rights use replication protocols to create a virtual DC. This allows them to request and extract sensitive data, such as NTLM password hashes. With this information, attackers can perform golden ticket attacks, account manipulation, LOTL attacks, and deploy ransomware.
		- Attackers use Mimikatz to perform DCSync attacks. Mimikatz includes a DCSync command that employs the Microsoft Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR) to mimic the behavior of a legitimate domain controller (DC).
		- Retrieve the NTLM password hashes of an administrator account: mimikatz “lsadump::dcsync /domain:(domain name) /user:Administrator”
	- Privilege Escalation by Abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS):
		- Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) is commonly deployed across the AD environment to manage certificates for applications, users, systems, and other entities within the network.
		- Misconfigured ADCS templates can create critical vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit for malicious activities, such as stealing credentials, escalating privileges, and establishing persistence.
		- Attackers can use tools like Certipy to identify and exploit misconfigured ADCS templates.
		- Certipy : Certipy is an offensive tool used for enumerating and exploiting Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS).
	- Other Privilege Escalation Techniques:
		- Access Token Manipulation:
			- In Windows operating systems, access tokens determine the security context of a process or thread, including the user's identity and privileges. After a user is authenticated, the system generates an access token, which is used by every process the user executes. The system verifies the access token when a process accesses a secured object.
			- Any Windows user can modify these access tokens, making the process appear to belong to a different user than the one who started it, thus adopting the new token's security context. For example, administrators typically log in as normal users and use the "runas" command to execute tools with elevated privileges. Attackers can exploit this to access other users' tokens or generate spoofed tokens, escalating privileges and performing malicious actions while evading detection.
		- Parent PID Spoofing:
			- Attackers attempt to bypass internal security mechanisms and escalate privileges by spoofing the parent process ID (PPID) of a newly created process. New processes typically inherit their PPID from their parent unless explicitly specified. This can be done by providing a PPID for the new process via the CreateProcess API. The API call includes specific arguments that determine which PPID to use.
			- The PPID can be set to that of system processes like svchost.exe or consent.exe, which are associated with Windows User Account Control (UAC). Attackers exploit these methods to bypass security restrictions on process spawning, evade tools that analyze parent-child relationships, and maintain persistence for privilege escalation.
		- Application Shimming:
			- Windows operating systems use the Windows Application Compatibility Framework, which includes "shims," to ensure compatibility between older and newer versions. For example, shimming allows programs designed for Windows XP to run on Windows 11. Shims act as a buffer between the program and the OS, checking if the program requires access to the shim database and using API hooking to redirect code for compatibility.
			- Shims installed by the default Windows installer (sbinst.exe) are stored at %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and in the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\InstalledSDB. Running in user mode, shims can't modify the kernel but can be exploited to bypass UAC, inject malicious DLLs, capture memory addresses, etc. Attackers use these to disable Windows Defender, escalate privileges, install backdoors, and perform other malicious activities.
		- Filesystem Permission Weakness:
			- Many processes in Windows operating systems automatically execute binaries as part of their functionality or to perform specific actions. If the filesystem permissions for these binaries are misconfigured, an attacker can replace the legitimate binary with a malicious one, and the process will execute it.
			- If the process running the binary has elevated permissions, the malicious binary will also execute with those higher privileges, potentially including SYSTEM privileges. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones, enabling privilege escalation. This technique is often used to manipulate Windows service binaries and self-extracting installers.
		- Path Interception:
			- Path interception is a technique where an attacker places a malicious executable in a specific path, causing the application to execute it instead of the legitimate target. Attackers can exploit various flaws or misconfigurations to perform path interception, such as unquoted paths (e.g., service paths and shortcut paths), misconfigured path environment variables, and search order hijacking.
		- Abusing Accessibility Features:
			- Attackers can establish persistence and escalate privileges by embedding and executing malicious code within Windows accessibility features. These features can be activated using key combinations even before a user logs into the system, allowing attackers to manipulate them and gain backdoor access without needing to log in.
			- In a Windows environment, these programs are typically stored in C:\Windows\System32\ and can be triggered by pressing specific keys during system reboot. Attackers can escalate privileges by replacing one of the accessibility features with cmd.exe or by modifying registry entries to launch malicious binaries when the key combination is pressed at the login screen. This technique enables attackers to gain system-level access.
			- Accessibility features abused by attackers:
				- On-screen keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
				- Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
				- Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
				- Display switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
				- App switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe
				- Sticky keys: C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
		- SID-History Injection:
			- In Windows, a Security Identifier (SID) is a unique value assigned to each user and group account by the domain controller (DC) at the time of creation. Active Directory (AD) accounts can store multiple SID values in the SID-history attribute, which is used when migrating a user from one domain to another.
			- Attackers exploit this feature by injecting the SID of an administrator or equivalent account with higher privileges into the compromised user account's SID-history attribute. This injection can elevate the user's privileges, allowing the attacker to access restricted resources or remote systems. Attackers can also move laterally within the domain by using further techniques, such as accessing remote services, SMB/Windows admin shares, or Windows Remote Management.
		- COM Hijacking:
			- The Component Object Model (COM) is an interface framework in Windows environments that allows one software component to interact with another without being aware of its actual implementation. Attackers exploit COM objects by hijacking valid references and replacing them with their own, allowing them to infect the target system and achieve persistence.
			- This process involves modifying or replacing object references with malicious content in the Windows Registry. When a user executes the commonly used object, the malicious code is automatically triggered, enabling the attacker to maintain persistence and potentially escalate privileges associated with the object.
			- COM hijacking techniques:
				- Exploiting the registry loading process by creating a malicious user object under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\ registry key, which is loaded by the system before the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\ registry key.
				- Interchanging legitimate DLLs or executable names with malicious payloads, causing the payloads to execute when the legitimate DLLs or executables are run.
				- Exploiting orphaned requests made by system components that are not yet defined in the registry, creating malicious COM objects for those requests in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry and mapping them to malicious payloads hidden in the file system.
		- Scheduled Tasks in Windows:
			- Scheduled tasks allow users to automate routine tasks on a computer. Windows includes utilities such as at and schtasks. A user with administrator privileges can use these utilities, along with Task Scheduler, to schedule programs or scripts to run at specific dates and times. If the user provides proper authentication, they can also schedule tasks remotely using Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
			- Attackers can exploit this technique to execute malicious programs at system startup, maintain persistence, perform remote execution, escalate privileges, etc.
		- Scheduled Tasks in Linux:
			- Linux utilizes cron or crond, an instruction-based utility, for automating task scheduling. Attackers exploit this utility to trigger malicious payloads when a specific task is scheduled for execution. The scheduler allows users with administrator privileges to configure cron jobs and execute them at specified times. cron runs commands from the crontab file, typically located at /etc/crontab.
			- Attackers can escalate privileges by modifying scripts executed by cron in /etc/crontab. By altering these scripts, attackers can ensure malicious code is executed automatically during system reboot, potentially gaining root privileges.
		- Launch Daemon:
			- During the macOS boot process, launchd is executed to complete the system initialization. It loads parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons and /Library/LaunchDaemons. These daemons have associated property list files (plists), which are linked to executables that run during boot.
			- Attackers can create and install a new launch daemon configured to execute at boot time by using launchd or launchctl to load plists into the appropriate directories. Weak configurations may allow attackers to alter the executable of an existing launch daemon, enabling them to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.
		- Plist Modification:
			- In macOS, plist (property list) files contain all the necessary information to configure applications and services. These files specify when programs should execute, the executable file path, program parameters, essential OS permissions, etc. Plist files are stored in specific locations, such as /Library/Preferences (which execute with elevated privileges) and ~/Library/Preferences (which execute with user-level privileges).
			- Attackers can access and modify these plist files to execute malicious code on behalf of a legitimate user, using them as a persistence mechanism and to escalate privileges.
		- Setuid and Setgid:
			- In Linux and macOS, when an application uses the setuid or setgid flags, the application executes with the privileges of the owning user or group, respectively. Normally, applications run under the current user’s privileges. However, there are situations where programs need to be executed with elevated privileges, even though the user running the program does not require them.
			- In such cases, the setuid or setgid flags can be set for the application. An attacker can exploit applications with the setuid or setgid flags to execute malicious code with elevated privileges.
		- Web Shell:
			- A web shell is a web-based script that provides access to a web server. Web shells can be created on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Attackers use web shells to inject malicious scripts onto a web server, enabling them to maintain persistent access and escalate privileges. A web shell acts as a backdoor, allowing attackers to gain access and control over a remote server.
			- Typically, a web shell runs under the current user’s privileges. Using a web shell, an attacker can escalate privileges by exploiting local system vulnerabilities. Once privileges are escalated, the attacker can install malicious software, modify user permissions, add or remove users, steal credentials, read emails, etc.
		- Abusing Sudo Rights:
			- Sudo (substitute user do) is a UNIX and Linux-based system utility that allows users to run commands as a superuser or root, using the security privileges of another user. The /etc/sudoers file contains the configuration for sudo rights, detailing access permissions, including which commands can be run with or without a password, for each user or group.
			- Attackers can exploit sudo to escalate their privileges and run programs that normal users are not authorized to execute. For example, if an attacker has sudo rights to run the cp command, they could overwrite the /etc/sudoers or /etc/shadow files with their own malicious files. By modifying the content of the sudoers file, the attacker could alter permissions to run restricted commands or programs, enabling further attacks on the system.
		- Abusing SUID and SGID Permissions:
			- Set User Identification (SUID) and Set Group Identification (SGID) are access permissions assigned to program files in UNIX-based systems. These permissions allow users to execute a program with temporarily elevated or root privileges in order to perform a specific task. Files with SUID and SGID rights run with higher privileges than those of the user running the program.
			- In Linux, certain commands and binaries can be exploited by attackers to escalate their privileges from non-root users to root, if the SUID and SGID flags are set. Some of the executable commands that attackers can use to spawn a shell and escalate privileges include nmap, vim, less, more, bash, cat, cp, echo, find, nano, and others.
			- Find SUID and SGID files in the target system:
				- Find SUID: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
				- Find GUID: find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
		- Kernel Exploits:
			- Kernel exploits refer to programs that take advantage of vulnerabilities in the kernel to execute arbitrary commands or code with elevated privileges. By successfully exploiting these kernel vulnerabilities, attackers can gain superuser or root-level access to the target system. To execute a kernel exploit, attackers typically need specific configuration details of the target system.
			- OS, kernel version, and architecture of the target system:
				- OS: cat /etc/issue
				- Kernel version: uname -a
				- Architecture: cat /proc/version
			- Detect kernel exploits for escalating privileges: www.exploit-db.com -> linprivchecker.py
		- Abusing '.' in the Path:
			- Adding . to the PATH allows users to execute binaries or scripts from the current directory. While convenient, this practice poses a security risk. If an attacker gains access to a system where a privileged user runs scripts from various directories, they can manipulate the PATH to include a malicious directory.
			- For example, by placing a malicious script named ls in the attacker-controlled directory, the system will execute it instead of the legitimate ls command. This enables the attacker to run arbitrary commands, potentially escalating privileges if the user has elevated permissions.
		- Abusing Elevation Control Mechanism on macOS:
			- Attackers may exploit the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API for privilege escalation. This API is designed to allow developers to perform operations requiring root privileges, such as software installation or updates. However, it lacks proper validation to verify whether root access requests come from a trusted source.
			- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges, enabling them to install malicious software and establish persistence on victim systems. When this API is invoked, the user is prompted for their credentials without any verification of the program’s source or integrity. Additionally, the program using the API may load world-writable files, which can be modified by attackers to execute malicious actions with elevated privileges.
		- Process Injection via Ptrace System Calls:
			- Attackers may exploit the ptrace (process trace) system call to inject malicious code into running processes, allowing them to evade process-based defenses and potentially escalate privileges. The ptrace system call enables attackers to debug a process, monitoring and manipulating its memory and register values.
			- Typically, ptrace injection involves writing arbitrary code into a running process (e.g., using malloc) and then using PTRACE_SETREGS to set the register that contains the next instruction to execute. Alternatively, attackers can use PTRACE_POKETEXT or PTRACE_POKEDATA to copy data into specific addresses in the target process's memory, such as the address of the next instruction to execute.
		- Abusing Microsoft Software Installer (MSI):
			- In Windows, MSI files act as databases that contain the dependencies and instructions necessary for installing and removing software. They also allow developers to execute additional scripts during installation, removal, or repair through Custom Actions. During software installation, MSI files are stored in the C:\Windows\Installer directory with randomized names and a .msi extension.
			- This setup enables regular users to use the "repair" functionality to fix issues like missing files, broken shortcuts, invalid registry entries, and other malfunctions. When invoked, the "repair" process can trigger critical actions, including file creation and execution, under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, even when initiated by a standard user.
			- If not properly managed, this can pose significant risks. Poorly configured Custom Actions running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to elevate privileges. Misconfigurations may allow file operations in directories writable by standard users, enabling attackers to modify files used by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and execute arbitrary code, ultimately escalating their privileges.
		- Abusing Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) - NoFilter Attack:
			- The NoFilter attack is a privilege escalation technique that exploits the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) on Windows 11 systems to gain system-level privileges. This method allows attackers to infiltrate deep into the operating system, run malicious child processes, execute malware with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, or even impersonate other logged-in users to maintain persistence without detection.
			- In this attack, the attacker first identifies the BfeRpcOpenToken method in the WFP by invoking WinAPI through RPC mapping using tools like RPC Mapper. The attacker then exploits the WFP to retrieve a handle to the access token of another process with system-level privileges from the NT handle table. After obtaining the handle to the targeted access token, the attacker uses it to create a copy of the token.
			- Methods for duplicating the acquired access token without triggering detection:
				- Token duplication via WfpAle component : This involves calling the WfpAleProcessTokenReference method in Windows, which causes the TCP/IP driver to duplicate the token and store it in the hash table. The LUID returned by the driver can be used to retrieve the duplicated access token.
				- Token duplication via IPsec connection : This method involves manipulating a user service to create an IPsec connection with the TCP/IP driver, which then duplicates the token and stores it in the hash table. Since the LUID of the token is not returned in this process, the token can only be retrieved by brute-forcing the LUID, which ranges from 1 to 4096.
			- Once the token is duplicated, the attacker can escalate privileges and perform high-level operations on the system, including duplicating tokens from services like LSM, Schedule, and Winmgmt.

## Maintaining Access
Use Different Techniques to Conceal Malicious Programs and Maintain Remote Access to the System.

- Executing Applications
	- When attackers execute malicious applications remotely on a victim’s machine, it is referred to as "owning" the system, enabling them to gather information for exploitation or privacy breaches, gain unauthorized access to system resources, exfiltrate data, capture screenshots, and install backdoors for sustained access.
	- Malicious Programs Executed by Attackers on Target Systems:
		- Backdoors
		- Crackers
		- Keyloggers
		- Spyware
	- Remote Code Execution Techniques:
		- Exploitation for Client Execution:
			- Web-Browser-Based Exploitation
			- Office-Applications-Based Exploitation (MS Office, Email Applications)
			- Third-Party Applications-Based Exploitation (Adobe Reader, Flash, etc.)
		- Service Execution
			- System services are backend programs in an OS. Attackers exploit them by running binaries or commands that interact with tools like the Service Control Manager, creating or modifying services to escalate privileges or maintain access.
		- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
			- WMI, a Windows feature, manages system resources locally and remotely. Attackers exploit it to access systems, gather data, and execute code to maintain access.
		- Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
			- WinRM is a Windows protocol that enables users to run executable files and modify system services or the registry on remote systems. Attackers exploit WinRM to execute payloads and facilitate lateral movement.

- Hiding Files
	- Rootkits
		- A rootkit is a stealthy malware program that enables attackers to gain and maintain unauthorized root-level access to a system while hiding their presence and malicious activities by modifying operating system components and utilities.
		- System hooking is the process of modifying and replacing the original function pointer with one provided by the rootkit in stealth mode. Inline function hooking is a technique in which a rootkit modifies some of the bytes of a function within core system DLLs (such as kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll), inserting an instruction so that any process calls are directed to the rootkit first.
		- Types of Rootkits:
			- Hypervisor-Level Rootkit : Hypervisor-level rootkits exploit hardware features like Intel VT and AMD-V to run in Ring-1, hosting the target OS as a virtual machine and intercepting all its hardware calls by altering the boot sequence to load themselves instead of the original virtual machine monitor.
			- Hardware/Firmware Rootkit : Hardware or firmware rootkits embed persistent malware in hardware components like the BIOS, hard drive, or network card, evading detection by hiding in firmware, which is rarely inspected for code integrity.
			- Kernel-Level Rootkit : A kernel-level rootkit operates in Ring-0 with the highest OS privileges, modifying kernel code or adding malicious code via device drivers (Windows) or loadable kernel modules (Linux). These rootkits are hard to detect, can destabilize the system if buggy, and can intercept or manipulate OS operations.
			- Boot-Loader-Level Rootkit : Boot-loader-level rootkits, or bootkits, operate by modifying or replacing the legitimate boot loader, allowing them to activate before the OS starts.
			- Application-Level/User-Mode Rootkit : An application-level/user-mode rootkit runs in Ring-3 alongside other applications, exploiting API behavior to replace standard application files (application binaries) or modify existing applications with patches or injected malicious code.
			- Library-Level Rootkits : Library-level rootkits operate high in the OS, patching, hooking, or replacing system calls with backdoor versions to conceal the attacker’s presence by hiding information.
			- Memory Rootkits : Memory rootkits, or volatile rootkits, are malware that reside solely in a system's RAM, leaving no traces on disk. Unlike traditional rootkits, they operate entirely in volatile memory, making them more elusive and harder to detect.
