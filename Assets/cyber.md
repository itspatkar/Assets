### Cyber Security Terminology

- **Offensive Security (Red Team) - Attacking:** Offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.

- **Defensive Security (Blue Team) - Defending/Protecting/Preventing:** Defensive security is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats; learn more in the digital forensics room.

- **Security Operations Center (SOC):** Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing , detecting , investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.

- **Threat Intelligence:** Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

- **Digital Forensics:** Forensics is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts.

- **Incident Response:** An incident usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation.

- **Malware Analysis:** Malware stands for malicious software. Software refers to programs, documents, and files that you can save on a disk or send over the network.

- **OWASP:** The Open Web Application Security Project is a nonprofit foundation focused on understanding web technologies and exploitations and provides resources and tools designed to improve the security of software applications.

- **IDOR:** Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. Broken access control means that an attacker can access information or perform actions not intended for them.

- **Virus:** Virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another; moreover, it works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer. The result ranges from the computer becoming slow to unusable.

- **Trojan Horse:** Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.

- **Ransomware:** Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a “ransom.”
