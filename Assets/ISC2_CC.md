An asset is anything with value, and a security practitioner may need to protect assets.
A threat is something or someone that poses risk to the organization; this is the definition of a threat.
A laptop, and the data on it, are assets, not threats. All the other answers are examples of threats because they all have the potential to cause adverse impact to the organization and its assets.
An event that has a significant probability of occurring ("high-likelihood") and also has a severe negative consequence (high-impact) poses the most risk.
Applying a security solution (a type of control) is an example of mitigation.
Sophia is accepting the risk that the money will be lost, even though the likelihood is high; Sophia has decided that the potential benefit (winning the bet), while low in likelihood, is worth the risk.
Phrenal has decided there is an acceptable level of risk associated with the online sale of the laptop; this is within Phrenal's risk tolerance.
A software firewall is a technical control because it is a part of the IT environment.

# Incident Respone

- Breanch : Incident Terminology While security professionals strive to protect systems from malicious attacks or human carelessness, inevitably, things go wrong. For this reason, security professionals also play the role of first responders. An understanding of incident response starts with knowing the terms used to describe various cyberattacks. The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where: a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information; or an authorized user accesses personally identifiable information for other than an authorized purpose. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5

- Attack :

- Event : Any observable occurrence in a network or system. NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2

- Exploit : A particular attack. It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities.

- Incident : An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits.

- Intrusion : A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization. IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2 (An intrusion is an attempt successful or otherwise to gain authurized access)

- Threat : Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/ or denial of service. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

- Vulnerability : Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

- Zero Day : A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures, or methods.

- Disclosure

--------------------------

Offensive Security (Red Team) : Attacking - Offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting vulnerabilities, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.

Defensive Security (Blue Team) : Defending/Preventing - Defensive security is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential threats.

SOC : The Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with  monitoring, preventing, detecting, investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.

OSINT : Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the act of gathering and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes.

Threat Intelligence : Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

OWASP : The Open Web Application Security Project is a nonprofit foundation focused on understanding web technologies and exploitations and provides resources and tools designed to improve the security of software applications.
IDOR : Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. Broken access control means that an attacker can access information or perform actions not intended for them.

Virus : Virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another; moreover, it works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer. The result ranges from the computer becoming slow to unusable.

Trojan Horse : Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.

Ransomware : Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a ransom.

HTML Injection : HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. If a website fails to sanitise user input (filter any "malicious" text that a user inputs into a website), and that input is used on the page, an attacker can inject HTML code into a vulnerable website.

SQL Injection : Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web application authentication methods to private or customer areas. - If web server of dbms throws sql error directly then it has sql injection vulnerability.

TOR : The Onion Router (TOR) is a network technology designed to improve your privacy and security on the internet by creating an anonymous communication pathway. It works by routing your internet traffic through a series of volunteer-operated servers (nodes) that encrypt and re-encrypt the data multiple times, making it very difficult to trace back to the original user.
