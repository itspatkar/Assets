Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing - Web Application & API

=> Reconnaissance/Enumeration
- Passive:
    - Network Analysis:
        - Whois Lookup -> whois

        - OSINT frameworks -> Recon-ng, Maltego
    - File/Source Code:
        - JavaScript Analysis: Parse & review client-side JS for secrets, API paths, keys, tokens, credentials, endpoints, URLs, private IPs, etc.
        - Backup/Config/Cache Files Check: Extensions like .old, .bak, .inc, .src
        - Metadata & Exposed Files: robots.txt, <META> tags, sitemap.xml, .htaccess, sensitive dirs/files
- Active:
    - Hosts Discovery (live hosts) -> ping, nmap, rustscan
    - Port Detection (open ports) -> nmap, masscan, rustscan
    - Service Detection -> nmap
    - DNS Probing/Enum (A, MX, TXT, CNAME, PTR) -> amass, dnsrecon, dnsenum
    - Subdomain Enum: amass, sublist3r, fierce, dnsrecon, dnsenum
    - Content Discovery:
        - Crawlers/URLs Extraction -> waybackurls, gau/gauplus, hakrawler
        - Directory/File Enum -> ffuf, dirsearch, gobuster, dirb/dirbuster
        - Endpoint Extraction (hidden admin panels, APIs, test/staging dirs) -> linkfinder, getJS, SecretFinder, hakrawler, AdminPBuster
        - Parameter Discovery/Fuzzing -> Arjun, ParamSpider, kxss, api-fuzzers/apibuster
    - Forced Browsing:
        - Common Directory (admin panels) -> /admin, /administrator, /backoffice, /backend
        - Ports (alternative ports) -> Tomcat on 8080

=> Email
- SPF / DKIM / DMARC checks and misconfig
- Email template injection, password reset via email vulnerability
- Open mail relays, mail server configuration

=> Penetration Testing
- Client-side:
    - Sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage, indexdb, cookies
    - Insecure CORS configuration: overly-permissive Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    - CSP missing or too permissive; missing SRI for third-party scripts
    - DOM-based vulnerabilities, client-side logic manipulation
    - Source-map exposure, debug endpoints
- Input flaws:
    - Identify all input points: Search, Registration/Login, Feedback/Contact forms, Coupon/Gift code fields, File uploads
    - SSTI, HTML injection
    - XSS (Reflected, Stored, DOM) -> In search, reviews, profile updates
    - SQLi (Classic, blind, time-based) -> login, product ID, filters
    - Command Injection -> file upload, image processing
    - XXE/XInclude -> file uploads, XML APIs
    - SSRF -> image fetchers, webhooks, PDF generation
- Authentication & Session:
    - Weak login flows -> Default/weak credential, credential stuffing, brute-force, password spraying
    - Login/Logout flaws & error-based enumeration (invalid user vs invalid password)
    - Forgot password flows -> token leakage, reset bypass
    - OTP/email verification bypass -> request/response tampering
    - Account lockout & rate-limiting bypass
    - Session flaws: fixation, token reuse, predictable session IDs
    - Session invalidation on logout, concurrent session controls, session binding to IP/user-agent
    - JWT issues -> insecure alg (none, HS256), weak secrets, token expiry
    - Cookie security -> missing flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
    - CSRF on state-changing requests
    - OAuth/OpenID misconfigurations
    - Race conditions in login/registration flows
- File Upload & Storage:
    - Upload bypasses:
        - Malicious extensions (.php, .php.jpg, .svg)
        - MIME type & content-type validation bypass
        - Magic bytes
    - Post-upload risks:
        - Stored XSS in file metadata or preview
        - Direct file access (/uploads/filename.jpg)
        - Unrestricted file download
    - Cloud Storage misconfig:
        - Open S3/GCS buckets or blobs, misconfigured blob storage
        - Public ACLs, exposed SAS tokens
        - Check CDN caching of sensitive content
- Business Logic Issues:
    - Rate-limiting bypass, account creation abuse, OTP re-use, price manipulation, concurrency/race in discounts or quota counters
    - Cart manipulation, order tampering, coupon stacking, payment flow bypass, unlimited redemption
    - Workflow abuse: refund/manipulation via sequence-of-steps faults
    - Race conditions -> multiple coupon/gift card redemption
- Role & Access Control Failures:
    - Privilege Escalation:
        - Access restricted paths (/admin, /superuser)
        - Modify role/permissions in requests
        - Anonymous vs authenticated users
    - IDOR/Broken Object Level Authorization:
        - Access other usersâ€™ orders (/orders/123)
        - Change user_id, product_id, invoice IDs in requests
        - Unauthorized access to invoices, payment details
        - Account/email enumeration

=> APIs, Microservices, GraphQL, WebSockets
- REST: missing auth on endpoints, improper rate-limiting, excessive data exposure
- GraphQL: introspection, excessive queries, schema leaks, query complexity DOS
- gRPC/WebSockets: authentication, message validation
- API parameter tampering: IDORs, mass assignment
- API versioning & deprecated endpoints
