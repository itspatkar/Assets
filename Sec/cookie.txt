- A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user’s computer by a web browser, typically in response to a Set-Cookie header sent by a web server. Cookies are generally limited to about 4 KB in size and consist of key–value pairs. They are automatically included in subsequent HTTP requests to the same domain.
- Cookies can be session-based (deleted when the browser closes) or persistent (stored until their specified expiration time).

Cookies are commonly used for:
- Session management (e.g., maintaining a logged-in state)
- Authentication tokens (e.g., storing login state securely)
- Tracking and analytics (e.g., monitoring user behavior)
- Advertising personalization

Security Aspects of Cookies:
- HttpOnly: Prevents client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) from accessing the cookie. Helps protect against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
- Secure: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections, preventing exposure on unencrypted channels.
- SameSite: Restricts cross-site cookie sharing, reducing the risk of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
- SameSite=Strict: Strictest, not sent with cross-site requests.
- SameSite=Lax: Sent for top-level navigation, safer balance.
- SameSite=None; Secure: Allows third-party cookies but only over HTTPS.
- Domain & Path restrictions: Control where cookies can be sent.
- Expiration/Max-Age: Defines cookie lifetime (session vs. persistent).

Risks if misconfigured:
- Storing sensitive data in cookies without encryption: data theft.
- Missing HttpOnly: cookies vulnerable to XSS theft.
- Missing Secure: cookies exposed in plaintext over HTTP.
- Weak SameSite policy: susceptible to CSRF.

Cookie Accessibility: Domain vs Subdomain:
- Cookie set on a domain (example.com):
    - Accessible to that domain and all its subdomains (e.g., app.example.com, shop.example.com).
- Cookie set on a subdomain (app.example.com):
    - Accessible only to that subdomain (app.example.com).
    - Not accessible to parent domain (example.com) or sibling subdomains (shop.example.com).
