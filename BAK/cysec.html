Firewall

Firewall Type   Description
Network Firewall    Protects an entire network from unauthorized access and attacks
Host-based Firewall Protects an individual computer from unauthorized access and attacks

Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Network Firewall is a firewall that protects an entire network from unauthorized access and attacks. Network firewalls can be hardware or software-based and are typically installed at the perimeter of a network to block unauthorized access from the internet.

Host-based Firewall is a firewall that protects an individual computer from unauthorized access and attacks. Host-based firewalls are typically software-based and are installed on individual computers to control access to network resources and block unauthorized traffic.

Firewalls use a variety of techniques to control and monitor network traffic, including packet filtering, stateful inspection, and application-level filtering. By blocking unauthorized access and filtering out malicious traffic, firewalls help to protect networks and the data transmitted over them from security threats.

VPN
VPN Type    Description
Site-to-Site VPN    Connects two or more networks together over the internet
Remote Access VPN   Allows remote users to securely access a private network over the internet

VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a technique used to create a secure and encrypted connection over the internet between two or more devices or networks.

Site-to-Site VPN connects two or more networks together over the internet, allowing devices on each network to communicate securely with devices on the other network(s). This is commonly used by businesses with multiple locations or by organizations that need to securely connect with partner networks.

Remote Access VPN allows remote users to securely access a private network over the internet. This is commonly used by employees who need to access company resources from a remote location, such as from home or while traveling. Remote access VPN can be configured to require user authentication and can be set up to provide access to specific network resources.

VPNs use encryption and tunneling protocols to ensure that data transmitted over the internet is secure and protected from unauthorized access. VPNs are commonly used in businesses and organizations to improve network security and enable remote access to network resources.

NAT
NAT Type    Description
Static NAT  Maps a public IP address to a single private IP address
Dynamic NAT Maps a public IP address to a pool of private IP addresses
PAT (Port Address Translation)  Maps a public IP address and port to a private IP address and port

NAT, or Network Address Translation, is a technique used to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.

Static NAT maps a single public IP address to a specific private IP address, while dynamic NAT maps a public IP address to a pool of private IP addresses. This allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address, as each device is assigned a unique private IP address from the pool.

PAT, or Port Address Translation, is a form of NAT that maps a public IP address and port to a private IP address and port. This allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address, with each device being assigned a unique port number.

NAT is commonly used in small to medium-sized networks to allow devices on a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address.

DNS
Record Type Description
A   Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address
AAAA    Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address
CNAME   Maps an alias hostname to the canonical hostname
MX  Specifies the mail exchange server(s) for a domain
TXT Stores arbitrary text data associated with a hostname
NS  Specifies the name server(s) for a domain

DNS, or Domain Name System, is a hierarchical naming system used to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses that machines can understand.

DNS uses various types of resource records, or DNS records, to store information about domain names and their associated IP addresses. The A record maps a hostname to an IPv4 address, while the AAAA record maps a hostname to an IPv6 address. The CNAME record maps an alias hostname to the canonical hostname.

The MX record specifies the mail exchange server(s) for a domain, while the TXT record stores arbitrary text data associated with a hostname. The NS record specifies the name server(s) for a domain.

DNS is a critical component of the internet infrastructure, and it is used for a wide range of applications, including web browsing, email, and online gaming.
