HTTP Host header

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :

The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML files, on the World Wide Web. It is the foundation of data communication on the web, and HTTP uses a client-server model, where clients initiate requests and servers respond with the requested resources. HTTP operates over TCP/IP, which ensures reliable delivery of data packets over networks. The protocol is stateless, meaning each request from a client is independent and not dependent on previous requests.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) :

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP used for secure communication over a computer network, particularly the internet. It encrypts the data sent and received between a user's browser and the website server, ensuring that the information remains confidential and protected from interception or tampering by unauthorized parties. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols to establish an encrypted connection between the client and the server.

# HTTP Protocol

The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML files, on the World Wide Web.
HTTP Methods :

HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request.

    GET Request : This is used for getting information from a web server.
    POST Request : This is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records.
    PUT Request : This is used for submitting data to a web server to update information.
    DELETE Request : This is used for deleting information or records from a web server.


HTTP Headers :

Headers are additional bits of data that are sent to the web server when making requests. Although no headers are strictly required when making an HTTP request, if they are not sent, it is difficult to view a website properly.

    Common Request Headers :
        Host : Some web servers host multiple websites, so by providing the host headers, the client instructs the server which one is required; otherwise, it receives the default website for the server.
        User-Agent : This is the browser software and its version number, which tells the web server which browser is being used, helping it format the website properly for that specific browser. Additionally, some elements of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are only supported in certain browser versions.
        Content-Length : When sending data to a web server, such as in a form, the content length tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way, the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.
        Accept-Encoding : Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet.
        Cookie : It is data that is sent to the server to help remember users information.
    Common Response Headers :
        Set-Cookie : Information to store as cookie, which gets sent back to the web server on each request.
        Cache-Control : How long should it take to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again.
        Content-Type : This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, PDF, video, etc. Using the content-type header, the browser then knows how to process the data.
        Content-Encoding : What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet.

Cookies :

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a user's computer by a web browser. Cookies are set by the "Set-Cookie" header received from a web server. Cookies are used for session management, tracking and analytics, advertising, etc.

=> HTTP Request Headers

- X-Original-URL: It is an HTTP request header sometimes used by reverse proxies, load balancers, or middleware to preserve the original URL path requested by a client before it was rewritten or altered by an intermediary component.
- X-Rewrite-URL
- X-Forwarded-For
- Referer
- Content-Disposition


=> Security Headers

Security headers are HTTP response headers that a web server includes to enhance the security of web applications and protect users from various types of attacks. They instruct the browser how to behave while handling content from the server and help prevent vulnerabilities like XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and data injection.

Header and Purpose:
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Forces browsers to use HTTPS, preventing protocol downgrade attacks.
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Restricts sources of content (scripts, styles, etc.) to prevent XSS and data injection.
- X-Content-Type-Options: X-Content-Type-Options Prevents MIME-type sniffing, which could lead to content being interpreted incorrectly.
- X-Frame-Options: X-Frame-Options Prevents the site from being embedded in iframes, mitigating clickjacking attacks.
- Referrer-Policy: Referrer-Policy Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests.
- Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy): Controls access to browser features like camera, microphone, geolocation, etc.
- Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP): Helps enforce secure cross-origin resource sharing.
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP): Specifies who can load the resource (same-site, cross-site, etc.).
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP): Isolates browsing context to prevent cross-origin attacks like Spectre.



=> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature built into web browsers that controls how a web page in one origin (domain) can request resources from a different origin. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a server-side configuration that affects how browsers (clients) handle cross-origin requests. CORS is server-related — the server must explicitly allow or deny cross-origin requests by setting specific HTTP response headers. If the server doesn’t include the right CORS headers, the browser blocks the response, even if the request succeeded.

CORS Headers and Role:
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies which origin(s) are allowed
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Lists allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST)
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Specifies allowed custom headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: Indicates if cookies/auth headers are allowed
- Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Defines which headers can be read by the browser



Optional/Legacy Headers

=> Pragma Header
The Pragma header is an HTTP/1.0 general header used for backward compatibility with older HTTP versions. It is mainly used for caching control. This tells the browser or intermediary caches not to cache the response, and instead always request a fresh copy from the server. In security testing, the presence or absence of the Pragma header is usually not a critical issue on its own, but it may be noted as part of secure caching practices, especially for sensitive content (like personal data, tokens, etc.).
- Pragma: no-cache

=> Cache-Control
Cache-Control is an HTTP header used to define caching rules for both requests and responses. It tells browsers and intermediate caches (like CDNs, proxies) what to store, for how long, and whether to revalidate.
- Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate

=> X-XSS-Protection
X-XSS-Protection is a legacy HTTP response header used to enable or disable the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter built into older versions of web browsers like Internet Explorer and early versions of Chrome. Enables XSS filtering and blocks the page entirely if an attack is detected (more secure than just sanitizing). Use the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header instead, which is much more powerful and reliable.
- X-XSS-Protection: 0
