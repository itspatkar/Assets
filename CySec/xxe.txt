=> XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

- XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a markup language used to store, structure, and transport data in a human-readable and machine-readable format.
- Key Characteristics:
    - Text-based format (plain text)
    - Hierarchical structure (tree-like)
    - Self-descriptive: data is wrapped in tags that describe it
    - Designed to be extensible â€” you define your own tags
    - Used widely in data exchange, configuration files, and web services
- XML Example:
    <user>
        <id>123</id>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <email>john@example.com</email>
    </user>
- Uses:
    - Web Services (SOAP uses XML)
    - Configuration Files (config.xml, Android manifest.xml)
    - Data Interchange (Between servers, databases, and applications)
    - Document Formats (Office files like .docx, .pptx, .xlsx)
    - RSS/Atom Feeds (News or blog feed syndication)
- XML vs. JSON:
    - Verbosity: XML is more verbose than JSON.
    - Readability: Both are human-readable, but JSON is considered more readable due to its cleaner syntax.
    - Data Types: XML supports only strings by default, whereas JSON supports multiple data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.
    - Usage: XML is commonly used in enterprise and legacy systems, while JSON is widely used in modern APIs and web applications.
