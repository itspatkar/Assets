Path Traversal

- Path Traversal, also known as Directory Traversal, is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files or access directories outside the intended file system structure of the application server.
- Path Traversal vulnerabilities happen because a web application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input used in file path operations. It happens when the app trusts the user to tell it which file to open, and doesn't check if the file is allowed or safe to access.
- To mitigate Path Traversal vulnerabilities, always validate and sanitize user input by rejecting sequences like ../ or encoded variants, and use whitelisting for file names and extensions. Ensure that resolved file paths stay within a specific base directory using secure APIs like realpath() or os.path.abspath(). Avoid directly using user input in file operations, enforce strict access controls, and configure the web server to block access to sensitive directories. Additionally, run applications with minimal file permissions and regularly test for traversal attacks using security tools.
