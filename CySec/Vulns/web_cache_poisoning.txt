=> Web Cache Poisoning

- Web Cache Poisoning is a web security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the content stored in a caching system (such as a CDN or reverse proxy), causing other users to receive malicious or misleading content from the cache instead of the correct, original version.
- It is an advanced technique that involves exploiting the behavior of both the web server and caching layer. The attack typically occurs in two phases:
    - The attacker identifies a way to elicit a backend response that unintentionally includes a harmful payload.
    - They ensure this malicious response is cached and then served to future users.
- A successfully poisoned cache can become a powerful delivery mechanism for various attacks, including reflected XSS, JavaScript injection, open redirection, and more.
